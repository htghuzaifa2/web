## 1. Check Your E-Challan Status (Province/City)
You must use the specific government portal for the region where the violation occurred. You will typically need your Vehicle Registration Number and the owner's CNIC (without dashes).

| Region | Verification Portal / App | Details Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Punjab** (Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, etc.) | **ePay Punjab App** or **PSCA E-Challan Portal** (`echallan.psca.gop.pk`) | Vehicle Number + CNIC/Chassis Number |
| **Islamabad (ICT)** | **ITP E-Challan Portal** (`traffic.islamabadpolice.gov.pk/Echallan`) or **Islamabad City App** | Vehicle Number + CNIC |
| **Sindh** (Karachi, Hyderabad, etc.) | **Sindh Police Challan Portal** (`sindhpolice.gov.pk/challan-check`) | Vehicle Number (Optional: CNIC) |

### Steps to Check and Generate PSID (Punjab Example):
1.  Visit the relevant official portal (e.g., ePay Punjab or PSCA Portal).
2.  Enter your **Vehicle Registration Number** and **CNIC** (or Chassis Number) exactly as per the excise record.
3.  The system will fetch and display all valid, unpaid e-challans.
4.  Select the desired challans for payment and click the option to **Generate Challan** or **Generate PSID**.
5.  A unique **17-digit PSID** (Payment Slip Identification Number) will be created. This number is your payment key.

## 2. Pay the E-Challan Online
Once you have the 17-digit PSID, you can use almost any digital banking channel in Pakistan to pay the fine.

| Payment Method | Steps |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile Banking / Internet Banking** | Log into your bank's app → Go to **Bill Payments** or **Government Payments** → Select **Traffic Challan** or **ePay Punjab/e-Challan** → Enter the 17-digit PSID → Confirm payment. |
| **Mobile Wallets (JazzCash/Easypaisa)** | Open the app → Select **Traffic Challan** or **Government Payments** → Enter the PSID → Pay instantly. |
| **ATM Machines (1-Link Network)** | Select **Bill Payments** → Choose **Traffic Challan** → Enter the PSID → Confirm the amount. |
| **Over the Counter (OTC)** | Print the challan slip with the PSID and pay in cash at any branch of the **Bank of Punjab (BOP)** or other partner banks. |

### Confirmation
After payment, you should receive an SMS confirmation from your bank, and the challan status should update to "Paid" on the respective police portal within 1–3 hours.
