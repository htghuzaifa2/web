I’ve always felt that Pakistani food is like a story — rich flavors, homey aromas, and memories tied to every dish. The good news is, you can enjoy these classics without feeling guilty, simply by making small tweaks.

## 1. Daal Chawal (Lentils with Rice)
A staple in almost every home.
*   **Tip:** Use minimal oil when tempering. Pair with brown rice or half brown-half white for extra fiber.
*   **Optional:** Add spinach, fenugreek, or tomatoes for extra vitamins.

## 2. Grilled or Tandoori Chicken
*   Marinate chicken in yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, and spices, then grill or bake instead of deep-frying.
*   Serve with a side of cucumber salad or steamed vegetables.

## 3. Bhindi (Okra) Masala
Bhindi is naturally low in calories but high in fiber.
*   **Tip:** Stir-fry with minimal oil and spices. Add onions, tomatoes, and a pinch of turmeric.

## 4. Chickpea Salad (Chana Chaat)
A street-food favorite made healthy.
*   Use boiled chickpeas, diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and green chilies.
*   Dress with lemon juice and chaat masala. Skip the fried sev.

## 5. Palak Paneer (Spinach with Cottage Cheese)
*   Use low-fat paneer or make your own.
*   Lightly sauté spinach with garlic and spices instead of heavy cream.
*   Pair with whole wheat roti.

## 6. Grilled Fish with Spices
*   Marinate fish fillets with lemon, garlic, chili, and coriander.
*   Grill or bake. Serve with fresh mint-cucumber raita.

## 7. Vegetable Khichdi
A one-pot meal combining rice, lentils, and vegetables.
*   Use brown rice or a mix of rice and lentils. Add carrots, peas, beans.
*   Cook with minimal oil.

### Quick Tips for Healthier Pakistani Cooking
*   Swap white flour with whole wheat in rotis.
*   Use olive oil or mustard oil sparingly instead of ghee.
*   Steam or grill instead of deep-frying.

### A Little Reflection
Pakistani food is rich, diverse, and full of love — and being healthy doesn’t mean losing any of that magic. Small tweaks can make your favorite recipes lighter, and still satisfying.
