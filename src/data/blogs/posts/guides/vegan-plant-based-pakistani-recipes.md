There are many creative and delicious vegan Pakistani recipes available online, ranging from traditional plant-based dishes to innovative vegan versions of classics.

## Best Resources

## 👩‍🍳 Tips for Veganizing
*   **Protein Swaps:** Use seitan or lentils/potatoes for meat in biryani/kababs. Use chickpeas for curries.
*   **Dairy Alternatives:** Coconut milk or cashew cream for rich dishes like Ras Malai.
*   **Authentic Flavor:** Rely on whole spices (cumin, coriander, methi) for that true taste.

## 💡 Where to Start
Begin with naturally vegan dishes like **Chana Masala** or **Daal**. For an adventure, try **Aloo Keema Samosas** using lentils.
