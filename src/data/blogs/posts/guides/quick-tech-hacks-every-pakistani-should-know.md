Here are quick, legit tech hacks every Pakistani—student, freelancer, or amma—can start using today. No fancy gear, no dollar subscriptions.

## 1. Download YouTube videos for offline sehri
Open YouTube → type `pp` after youtube.com (e.g., youtubepp.com/watch...) → lands on save-from.net. Works on 2G.

## 2. Turn your USB into a password key for PC
Download **Predator Free**. Set USB as “unlock token”. Remove USB → screen locks. Perfect for hostels.

## 3. OTG tricks that save emergency money
*   **USB Fan:** Cool during UPS beeps.
*   **LED Light:** Study lamp.
*   **Gamepad:** Play PUBG on budget phone.
*   **File Transfer:** Copy from pen-drive without laptop.

## 4. JazzCash/Easypaisa screenshot trick
Rename screenshots with date + purpose (e.g., Tuition-Jan-26). Instant proof for bank disputes.

## 5. Google Maps offline for inter-city buses
Download map area before leaving Wi-Fi. No data needed on Motorway.

## 6. Wi-Fi QR for guests
Use `qiwi.netlify.app` to generate QR for your Wi-Fi. Print & tape near kettle.

## 7. Compressor for LMS uploads
University LMS reject > 20 MB? Drag to **tool.huzi.pk** → shrink 80%.

## 8. Screenshot scroll
Samsung/Xiaomi: Power + Vol Down → “Scroll capture”. Stitches long chats.

## 9. Night-time mobile amplifier
Place phone inside empty plastic bottle (cut top). Natural amplifier.

## 10. Cyber-hygiene
*   Never open ".pdf" files from unknown numbers (malware risk).
*   Enable App Lock on financial apps.
