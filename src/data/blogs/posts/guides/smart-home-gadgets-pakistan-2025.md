I was tightening a loose ceiling fan screw last Sunday when the electrician casually said, "Baji, ab tou ghar khud hi chalte hain—apka fan bhi phone se chalega."
That tiny boast got me thinking: which of these “smart” things really survive our voltage fluctuations, 2-G data pockets and budget constraints?
So I scoured markets to short-list gadgets that give back more than they demand.

## 1. Smart Wi-Fi Bulbs – the gateway drug
Screw in, connect to home Wi-Fi, done.
*   **Best for:** Scheduling Iftar dimming or 5 a.m. sehri low-light.
*   **Pro tip:** Buy one for the porch first—automatic sunset-to-sunrise keeps burglars guessing.

## 2. Smart Plug – make ANY appliance “app-wala”
Old geyser, new trick. Plug into this adapter, set a timer.
*   **Savings:** Roughly PKR 900 a month. Pays for itself in six weeks.
*   **UPS-safe?** Yes, up to 16 A.

## 3. Wi-Fi Smart Switch – goodbye, 3-gang monster plate
Replace the ugly plastic board with a glass touch panel. Control lights/fan from bed.
*   **Note:** Get a neutral-wire-free version for old Karachi houses.

## 4. Video Doorbell – speak to the Qurier
1080p, two-way talk, night vision. Sends photo to WhatsApp.
*   **Great for:** Wives, sisters, or anyone who’d rather not shout “Kaun?” through the keyhole.

## 5. Smart Lock with Finger-print – no more “chabi kahan rakhi?”
Stores 100 prints. Auto-locks at 11 p.m. Mechanic key backup for load-shedding days.

## 6. Smart Camera Hub – watch the darzi and the driver
Aqara G5 Pro gives 2K video, colour night vision, and doubles as a Zigbee hub. Local storage via micro-SD.

## 7. Robot Vacuum – jharoo after dinner is overrated
Vacuums and mops, empties itself. Climbs 2 cm door sills common in Islamabad houses.

## 8. Smart Thermostat – cool kamyabi without melting the bill
Learns your routine. Saves up to 23% on summer electricity.

## 9. Motorised Curtains – luxury that feels necessary at Fajr
Curtain opens automatically, mimicking azaan time so you never oversleep.

## 10. Energy-Monitoring Power Strip
Six individually controlled outlets; real-time watts on the app.

### Where I shop (without grey-market anxiety)
*   HomeGenius.pk – local warranty on switches & locks
*   OkashaSmart.com – cameras, bulbs, plugs
*   MTronic.pk – full automation packages
*   WaltonMarket.com – budget starter bundles

### Parting chai-sip wisdom
Don’t automate everything; automate the boring bits first—lights at Maghrib, geyser timing.
And if you ever need a pocket-sized tool to compress that camera footage, I’ve left a few on **tool.huzi.pk**.
