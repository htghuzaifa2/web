The price of gold in Pakistan is dynamic, driven by both global market forces and local economic conditions. Here is a look at the current prices, what influences them, and what analysts are forecasting for the year ahead.

## 📊 Current Gold Prices
As of late 2025, the price for 24-karat gold in major cities like Karachi and Lahore hovers around **PKR 456,000 per tola**.

## 🔑 Key Drivers of Gold Prices
| Driver | How It Affects Price in Pakistan |
| :--- | :--- |
| **International Price (USD)** | Primary Driver. When the global dollar price rises, the rupee price follows. |
| **PKR/USD Exchange Rate** | Critical Multiplier. A weaker rupee makes imported gold more expensive. |
| **US Fed Policy** | Lower US interest rates often weaken the dollar and boost gold. |
| **Local Demand** | Wedding season and local taxes add a premium to the international rate. |

## 📈 Gold Price Forecasts for 2026
Analyst forecasts for 2026 vary, but generally point upwards.

| Source / Type | 2026 Forecast (per ounce) | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UBS** | $4,500 | Based on expected US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. |
| **Conservative** | $4,400 - $4,700 | Projects a continued bullish trend with moderate growth. |
| **Bullish** | Up to $6,800 | Factors in sustained central bank buying and volatility. |

## 💎 Practical Advice
*   **Monitor Key Indicators:** Keep an eye on the PKR/USD exchange rate.
*   **Understand the Local Premium:** Check rates from the APSGJA for accurate local pricing.
*   **Treat Forecasts as Guides:** The market is volatile; use forecasts to understand scenarios, not as guarantees.
