Below is the step-by-step, zero-jargon route from “I want plastic” to “I can tap and pay”—all tested on hostel Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## 🏦 Step 1: Pick Your Bank (Wi-Fi Friendly)

| Bank | Min. Salary | Apply Online? | Perks for Students |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Chartered** | Rs 40,000 | ✅ Link | Cashback on food delivery |
| **Bank AL Habib** | Rs 20,000 | ✅ Link | 51 interest-free days |
| **UBL** | Rs 40,000 | ✅ Link | Instant approval SMS |

*Tip: salary < 40k? → go Bank AL Habab; > 40k → Standard Chartered for better rewards.*

## 📄 Step 2: Documents You Need (Hostel-Friendly)
*   **CNIC** (front + back photo)
*   **Last 3 salary slips** (PDF or photo)
*   **6-month bank statement** (download from mobile app → PDF)
*   **Job letter** (HR email PDF works)
*   **Utility bill** (hostel warden signs a “residence certificate” if bill isn’t in your name)
*   *No job? → open a “student savings account” first, then apply—some banks issue low-limit cards to existing customers.*

## 💻 Step 3: Apply Online (5-Minute Form)
1.  Click bank link above → fill form ( name, CNIC, salary, city ).
2.  Upload docs → submit.
3.  Wait 24-48 hrs → approval SMS arrives if salary & ECIB clear.
4.  **Instant card?** → Bank Alfalah Alfa app → pre-approved customers get virtual card in < 5 min.

## 🎯 Step 4: Activate & Use
*   Physical card delivered in 3-5 days → sign back, call helpline to activate.
*   Add to Google Pay → tap at metro, cafeteria, Daraz checkout.
*   Set auto-debit to full amount → avoid interest trap.

## ⚠️ Quick Reality Check
*   **Interest-free period:** up to 51 days if you pay full bill on time.
*   **Cross-border limit:** USD 30,000/year (SBP rule).
*   **Late payment:** 2.5 % monthly → never miss deadline → set calendar reminder.

## 🚀 One-Week Action Plan
1.  Pick bank above → open link on phone.
2.  Collect docs → PDF everything.
3.  Submit form → wait for SMS.
4.  Activate card → tap first coffee → feel adult.

Lock this plan → 2025 you will be the one tapping the metro gate while others hunt for change.
