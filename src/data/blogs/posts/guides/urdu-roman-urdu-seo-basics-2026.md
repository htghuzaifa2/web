If you’re creating content for Pakistan, Urdu and Roman Urdu searches are growing fast. Optimizing for them is simpler than it seems.

## 1. Why It Matters
*   **High Volume:** Many search "mobile phone ka price" or "موبائل فون کی قیمت".
*   **Low Competition:** Fewer optimized pages than English.
*   **Local Relevance:** Improves engagement and trust.

## 2. Choosing Keywords
*   **Roman Urdu:** Typed phonetically (e.g., "urdu shayari", "online shopping pakistan").
*   **Urdu Script:** Direct Urdu searches (e.g., "اردو شاعری").
*   **Tip:** Use Google Trends to check search volume.

## 3. On-Page SEO Tips
*   **Titles/Headings:** Include keywords naturally.
*   **Meta Description:** Use the target script.
*   **URL Slugs:** Use transliterated Roman Urdu (e.g., `/urdu-poetry`) – avoid complex Urdu script in URLs.
*   **Content:** Mix both scripts if relevant.

## 4. Content Optimization
*   Keep paragraphs short and mobile-friendly.
*   Use bold headings for keywords.
*   Internal links to related content.

## 5. Image & Video SEO
*   Use alt text in Roman Urdu/Urdu.
*   Captions help Google understand visual content.

## 6. Tools
*   Google Keyword Planner.
*   Ubersuggest & SEMrush.

### A Little Reflection
SEO in Urdu is about understanding how people type. With thoughtful keyword choices, you can reach a local audience many sites overlook.
