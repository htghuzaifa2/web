Fresh faces are stealing scenes and galleries alike. Below are the new names you’ll be dropping in hostel common-room conversations before they become household brands.

## 🎬 Breakout Actors of 2025

| Name | Drama Debut | Why they’re on radar |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ayan Ahmed** | Sher & Biryani | Held his own against veterans like Salman Shahid; two different roles, same confidence. |
| **Abu Huraira** | Meem Se Mohabbat | Played a non-speaking mentally disturbed child with zero dialogue – still stole every scene. |
| **Nazeeha Zainab** | Jama Taqseem | Innocent Sidra became fan-favourite from day one; natural acting + innocent look = instant connect. |
| **Elahi Bux Khan** | Jama Taqseem | Theatre background; portrayed Zeeshan’s sleaziness → depression arc flawlessly. |
| **Nameer Khan** | Qarz e Jaan | Breakout star of 2025 – made audience fall for a criminal (Ammar) with layered vulnerability. |
| **Fajr Sheikh** | Qarz e Jaan | Theatre artist; delivered trauma of a woman who lost everything without going OTT. |
| **Abul Hassan** | Parwarish | Content-creator-turned-actor; blended comic relief into serious themes seamlessly. |

*Campus verdict: boys who never watch dramas binged Qarz e Jaan just to see Nameer’s breakdown scenes.*

## 🎨 Visual Artists to Watch

| Artist | Medium | Why they matter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Faiza Butt** | Pointillism + photographic illusion | NCA + Slade grad; miniature-scale detail, museum-level shows. |
| **Safdar Ali Qureshi** | Abstract miniature | Captures memory in motion with swirls/dashes; teaches at SABS University. |
| **Imran Qureshi** | Site-specific miniatures | Revives 16th-century Mughal techniques but on walls/installations. |
| **Sana Arjumand** | Mystical painting | Birds, light, dream symbols; explores inner anxiety of modern life. |
| **Shehnaz Ismail** | Textile preservation | Documents indigenous embroidery from mountain regions; IVSAA head. |

*Insider tip: Imran Qureshi’s next site-specific piece is rumoured for Lahore Biennale 2026 – bookmark it now.*

## 🏆 Fresh-off-the-stage wins
*   **Lux Style Awards 2025** crowned Samar Jafri (Best Film Actor) and Khushhal Khan (Emerging Talent Drama) – proof the new wave is official.
*   **Digital Dream YouTube channel** (by Adnan Siddiqui) is hunting next-gen actors – submit monologue videos if you’ve got the itch.

## 🔥 Quick cheat-sheet
1.  **Watch next:** Ayan Ahmed in Sher & Biryani (Hum TV) – he’s the campus crush waiting to happen.
2.  **Follow next:** Faiza Butt on Instagram – her pointillism close-ups are phone-wallpaper gold.

Lock these names → 2026 you’ll say “I knew them before they were cool” while the common-room still plays their old dramas on repeat.
