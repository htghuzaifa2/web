I was sipping elaichi chai at a roadside café in Lahore last week when a fellow blogger slid her phone across the table and whispered, “Baji, my traffic vanished after Google’s new AI Mode rolled out—what do I do?”
That tiny panic in her eyes felt familiar; we’ve all seen our page-one dreams shrink to a single AI paragraph.
Below are the exact, low-drama steps I’m taking so our desi blogs still get discovered.

## 1. Think topics, not just keywords
AI Mode breaks one query into 10-16 micro-questions. If you only target “best biryani in Karachi”, you miss “biryani calories” or “price near me”.
*   **Fix:** Build a topic cluster. Write a pillar post summarizing every angle, then cluster posts for micro-queries.

## 2. Serve data with your story
AI Mode cites numbers aggressively.
*   **Example:** In a “Ramadan menu planner”, I added inflation rates and iftar timing tables.
*   **Moral:** Drop at least one hard stat or table per article; it becomes the hook the AI grabs.

## 3. Speak like a friend, not a textbook
Google’s Gemini model rewards conversational language.
Instead of “Purchase economical apparel online”, type: “Looking for budget kurtas under 2,000 PKR? Here’s where I actually shop.” The second line mirrors real voice queries.

## 4. Mark-up your goodies (schema ≠ scary)
Add schema plugins to WordPress: Article, FAQPage, HowTo, LocalBusiness.
Validate with Google’s Rich Results Test. It takes 90 seconds and lifts you into “trusted source” territory.

## 5. Optimise for multimodal – images, video, audio
Pakistan’s 4G is cheap; cameras are cheaper.
Shoot a 30-second vertical video while cooking. Upload with descriptive filenames and Roman Urdu captions. AI Mode’s Live feature can surface your clip.

## 6. Keep off-site signals alive
Share every post in local Facebook groups. Answer Quora questions. Encourage WhatsApp shares. Unlinked brand chatter whispers “authority” into AI Mode’s ear.

## 7. Measure the right numbers now
Clicks will drop. Watch **Impressions inside AI Overviews**, **Session depth**, and **Conversion rate**. These metrics tell you if AI is sending better people.

## 8. Speed & mobile – still non-negotiable
A 3-second load time on 4G feels like 10 seconds on patchy 3G. Compress images, lazy-load videos.

## 9. Humanise your by-line
AI Mode distrusts anonymity. Add a short editor bio: “Huzi is a Lahore-based writer who once ate nihari at 4 a.m. just for this article.” Link to social handles.

## 10. Keep a micro-tool belt handy
For quick tasks like generating FAQ schema or compressing images, stash lightweight utilities on **tool.huzi.pk**.

### Calm closing thought
Optimising for AI Mode is less about tricking a robot and more about feeding it real, fragrant, Karachi-street-level life. Add data, add voice, add visuals—then let the algorithms borrow your authenticity.
