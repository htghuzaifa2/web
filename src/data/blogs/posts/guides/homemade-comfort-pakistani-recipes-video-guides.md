## 1. The Weekday Savior: Daal (Lentil Curry)
Daal is the heartbeat of Pakistani home cooking – budget‑friendly, healthy, and endlessly versatile.

- **Recipe**: Masoor ki Daal (Red Lentils) or Kali Daal (Black/Brown Lentils).
- **Why It Works**: Simple boil‑and‑tarka method; the tarka (tempering) adds smoky, restaurant‑style flavor.
- **Video Tip**: Look for tutorials that clearly show the tarka preparation and the water‑to‑dal ratio.

## 2. The Party Classic: Chicken Karahi
A bold, spicy dish that’s surprisingly easy to make at home.

- **Recipe**: Boneless Chicken Karahi or White Chicken Karahi.
- **Why It Works**: Only four fresh ingredients – tomatoes, ginger, green chilies, garlic – plus simple spices.
- **Video Tip**: Pay attention to the timing of tomato cooking and yogurt addition (for White Karahi) to avoid splitting.

## 3. The Perfect Snack: Shami Kebab
Soft inside, crispy outside – great for meal‑prep and gatherings.

- **Recipe**: Reshay Walay Shami Kebab (Shredded).
- **Why It Works**: Boiled ground meat (or chicken) with chana daal, spices, then shredded for texture before shaping and frying.
- **Video Tip**: Look for videos that show the texture after boiling and the shredding technique.

## 4. A Simple Sweet End: Sooji Ka Halwa
A quick, comforting semolina pudding.

- **Recipe**: Quick Sooji Ka Halwa (Semolina Pudding).
- **Why It Works**: Just semolina, sugar, ghee, and water/milk – ready in under 20 minutes.
