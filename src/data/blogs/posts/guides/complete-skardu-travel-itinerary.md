Skardu has always felt like a little slice of heaven to me. Surrounded by towering mountains, turquoise lakes, and endless skies, it’s the kind of place that makes you pause, breathe, and just exist for a moment. If you’re planning a trip to northern Pakistan, Skardu should definitely be on your list. Here’s a travel itinerary I personally love, crafted to help you experience the best of this breathtaking region.

## Day 1: Arrival and Settling In
When you first arrive in Skardu, take it slow. The drive from Islamabad or Gilgit is long, but every turn reveals stunning scenery. I always recommend starting with a simple stroll around the Skardu Bazaar — it’s colorful, lively, and perfect for picking up some local handicrafts.
*   **Tip:** Try some warm butter tea at a local café. It’s rich, comforting, and the perfect way to ease into the altitude.

## Day 2: Shangrila & Upper Kachura Lake
On your second day, head to Shangrila Resort for iconic photo spots and serene views. From there, continue to Upper Kachura Lake, a hidden gem with crystal-clear water that feels untouched. I like to pack a small picnic and just sit by the shore, watching the reflections of the mountains — it’s peaceful and grounding.
*   **Travel Tip:** Roads can be bumpy; a sturdy vehicle is a must.

## Day 3: Deosai National Park
If you love nature, Deosai National Park is a must. Known as the “Land of Giants,” it’s one of the highest plateaus in the world. I remember hiking there early in the morning — the grasslands stretch endlessly, and sometimes you see Himalayan brown bears from a safe distance.
*   **Pro Tip:** Start early and carry snacks, water, and warm clothing. Weather changes quickly at these altitudes.

## Day 4: Sheosar Lake & Surrounding Valleys
Spend your fourth day exploring Sheosar Lake, famous for its turquoise water and stunning backdrop. On the way, stop by smaller valleys and villages. I love talking to locals and tasting freshly made apricot jam or local bread. It’s small moments like these that make travel feel authentic.

## Day 5: Skardu Fort & Sunset Views
Before leaving, visit Skardu Fort. Climb up the hill for panoramic views of the city, rivers, and surrounding peaks. I usually stay until sunset — the way the mountains glow as the sun dips is unforgettable.
*   **Evening Idea:** Walk along the Shigar River and grab some local snacks from a nearby stall. Nothing fancy, just pure local flavor.

## Travel Tips for a Smooth Trip
*   **Best Time to Visit:** June to September — roads are accessible, and the weather is pleasant.
*   **Stay Local:** Guesthouses in Skardu are cozy and give you a feel of local life.
*   **Pack Wisely:** Warm clothes, sunscreen, and comfortable shoes are essentials.
*   **Transportation:** Hiring a local driver can save time and stress, especially on mountain roads.

Skardu isn’t just about sightseeing; it’s about slowing down, connecting with nature, and feeling the vastness of northern Pakistan. Every lake, valley, and street in the bazaar has a story, and walking there makes you feel part of something timeless.

*If you’re planning your trip, I sometimes check for local gear, travel accessories, and snacks on huzi.pk — it helps me stay prepared without overpacking.*

Visiting Skardu is more than a trip — it’s a gentle reminder that the world has corners of beauty that make you stop and truly breathe.
