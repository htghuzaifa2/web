Below is the shortest route from “I don’t understand taxes” to “I pay ₹0 tax and still file legally” – all tested on hostel Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## ✅ Step 1: Register (5 minutes online)
1.  Go to: **fbr.gov.pk** → click “Register for NTN” → fill CNIC + mobile.
2.  OTP arrives → you now have an NTN → you’re a legal filer.

## 💰 Step 2: Understand Your Tax Rate (30 seconds)

| Income Range (₹/year) | Tax Rate | Hostel Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Up to ₹ 600,000** | 0 % | You pay ₹ 0 – perfect for hostel budgets |
| **₹ 600k–1.2 M** | 15 % | Pay ₹ 90k + 15 % on excess |
| **₹ 1.2 M–1.6 M** | 20 % | Pay ₹ 170k + 20 % on excess |

*Hostel hack: if you earn < ₹ 50k/month, you pay ₹ 0 – still file to stay on ATL.*

## 🧾 Step 3: Claim Deductions (₹ 0 Cost)
**What you can deduct (keep photos in WhatsApp):**
*   Internet bills (hostel Wi-Fi receipt)
*   Laptop purchase (invoice photo)
*   Software subscriptions (Canva, ElevenLabs receipts)
*   Business travel (bus tickets, fuel receipts)
*   Donations to approved charities (FBR-approved NGOs)

*Hostel hack: keep a Google Sheet → log every expense → upload receipts to WhatsApp.*

## 🌍 Step 4: Foreign Income Hack (₹ 0 Tax)
*   **Export income** (Upwork, Fiverr, direct clients) = 0.25 % tax if registered with PSEB.
*   Register with **PSEB** → fee ₹ 5,000 → pay ₹ 0 tax on foreign income.
*   *Hostel hack: register via pseb.org.pk → upload NTN + bank certificate.*

## 🧾 Step 5: File Return (30 minutes)
1.  Log in to FBR IRIS → fill income + expenses.
2.  Upload receipts (photos from WhatsApp).
3.  Submit before 30 September → you’re a legal filer, ₹ 0 tax due.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Checklist
1.  **Tonight:** register NTN → save in WhatsApp.
2.  **Tomorrow:** log expenses → save receipts in WhatsApp.
3.  **Weekend:** register PSEB → upload bank certificate.
4.  **September:** file return → submit before 30 Sept.

Lock this checklist → 2025 you will be “the guy who pays ₹0 tax and still files legally” while others still hunt for change.
