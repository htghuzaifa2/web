I still remember the “Murree snow-trip” where my DSLR battery died, yet the viral shot was taken on a Rs 28,000 Infinix. Here are the habits I follow.

## 1. Start with the chai-wala wipe
Lens grease ruins sharpness. Wipe lens with a napkin before shooting. Instant 30% clarity boost.

## 2. Grid-lines = “rule of thirds”
Turn on grid lines. Place mountain peak or Minar-e-Pakistan on cross-points.

## 3. Volume button = stable shutter
Don't tap the screen (shakes the phone). Hold with both hands and press volume-down.

## 4. Skip digital zoom
Walk closer. Cropping later in Snapseed is better than digital zoom blur.

## 5. HDR Auto for high-contrast
Essential for Hunza valleys (bright snow + dark mountains). Keeps detail everywhere.

## 6. Burst mode for street action
Long-press shutter for rickshaws and bazaars. Pick the best frame later.

## 7. Reflections = free double-shot
Shoot puddles in Lahore Food Street for mirror images.

## 8. Portrait mode for objects
Blur background for chai cups to make steam pop. Keep subject 8-12 inches away.

## 9. Golden hour = Maghrib magic
Shoot 20 min before sunset or after sunrise. Soft, warm light.

## 10. Edit on the bus – Snapseed
*   Crop/Straighten.
*   Tune: +Shadows, -Highlights.
*   Selective: Brighten faces.
*   Details: +Structure.
*   White Balance: Warm +2.

## 11. Backup before biryani
Enable Google Photos backup. Lose phone ≠ lose memories.

## 12. Safety & respect
*   Ask before shooting people.
*   No drone? Use panoramas from rooftops.
*   Avoid built-in flash at night; use a friend's phone torch.

Your phone is the only DSLR you need from Karakoram to Karachi.
