It is quick and easy to unsend a message on Instagram's Direct Messages (DMs), and it will remove the message for both you and the recipient. This works for texts, photos, videos, voice notes, and shared posts. The process is the same whether you are using the Instagram mobile app or the desktop website.

## How to Unsend a Message on Instagram

### On Mobile App (iOS or Android):
1.  **Open the Chat:** Launch the Instagram app and tap the Messages icon (paper airplane or speech bubble) in the top-right corner.
2.  **Locate the Message:** Open the conversation thread that contains the message you want to retract.
3.  **Tap and Hold:** Long-press (tap and hold) on the specific message bubble you wish to unsend.
4.  **Select Unsend:** A menu will pop up. Tap **Unsend** from the options.
5.  **Confirm:** Tap Unsend again to confirm the action.
    *   *The message will instantly disappear from the chat history for everyone in the conversation.*

### On Instagram Website (Desktop/Browser):
1.  **Open the Chat:** Go to instagram.com and access your Direct Messages.
2.  **Locate the Message:** Open the conversation thread.
3.  **Find the Menu:** Hover your mouse cursor over the message you want to unsend. A three-dot icon (...) will appear next to the message.
4.  **Select Unsend:** Click the three dots (...) and choose **Unsend**.
5.  **Confirm:** Confirm the action in the pop-up window.

## Key Things to Know About Unsending
*   **No Time Limit:** There is no time limit for unsending messages on Instagram. You can retract a message immediately after sending it, or even days, weeks, or months later.
*   **Deletes for Everyone:** Unsending a message deletes it permanently for all participants in the chat, including group chats.
*   **The Recipient is Not Notified:** Instagram does not send a notification to the recipient that a message was unsent (unlike some other messaging apps). If you unsend it quickly, the push notification containing the message preview will also disappear from the recipient's phone.
*   **Read Messages Can Be Unsent:** You can unsend a message even if the recipient has already read it. However, if they have already read it, the purpose of unsending is defeated.
*   **No Mass Unsend:** You must unsend each message individually. Deleting the entire chat thread only removes the conversation from your inbox; the recipient will still see all your messages.
