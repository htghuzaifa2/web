I opened my last KE bill and actually smiled—Rs 1,840 instead of Rs 7,200. The change? 16 solar panels.
Below is the math I wish I knew earlier.

## 1. How solar slashes your bill
Day-time: panels produce power. Night-time: buy from grid.
**Result:** Monthly units drop 50-90%.

## 2. Realistic savings numbers (25 years)
| System | Monthly Offset | Monthly Saving | 25-Year Saving |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3 kW** | ~330 kWh | Rs 10,500 | Rs 24 lakh |
| **5 kW** | ~550 kWh | Rs 17,600 | Rs 40 lakh |
| **7 kW** | ~770 kWh | Rs 24,600 | Rs 56 lakh |

## 3. Pakistan-specific cost & pay-back (2025)
*   **Avg Price:** Rs 120/watt. (3kW = ~Rs 360k).
*   **Pay-back:** 3.5 – 4.5 years.
*   **Life:** 25 years warranty.

## 4. Net-metering – the bonus cheque
Apply via DISCO. Export surplus units. DISCO pays wholesale rate (curr. ~Rs 19/unit) for net surplus.

## 5. Finance options
*   **Bank Alfalah:** 6% first year.
*   **SBP Scheme:** 3% (cheapest).
*   **Installer Lease:** 0% (but higher price).

## 6. Hidden costs
*   Insurance (~Rs 3k/yr).
*   Cleaning (Rs 1.5k/session).
*   Inverter replacement (once in 10 yrs).
*   Roof reinforcement.

## 7. Should YOU do it now?
*   **Go solar IF:** Bill > Rs 6k, Own roof, Plan to stay > 4 yrs.
*   **Wait IF:** Rented, Bill < Rs 3k, Roof weak.

## 8. First step this week
WhatsApp your bill to a local installer asking for a quote. Order a cleaning kit to test dust loss.

### 🌞 Parting chai thought
Solar is a 4-year fixed deposit that pays monthly. Lock your tariff today.
