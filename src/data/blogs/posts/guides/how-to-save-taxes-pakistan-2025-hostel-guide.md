Below are the legal, FBR-approved tricks that actually drop your tax bill – no offshore accounts, no “my uncle’s lawyer” drama.

## 🏢 Salaried? Use these hacks before December 31

| Deduction | How much you save | What you need to do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Children’s education** | Up to Rs 60,000 per child (max 25 % of taxable income) | Submit fee receipts to HR via Form 3 → lower monthly tax |
| **Medical allowance** | 10 % of basic salary tax-free | Ask HR to structure medical as allowance not reimbursement |
| **Zakat payment** | 100 % deduction under Ordinance | Pay through bank → collect receipt → claim in return |
| **Donations to approved NPOs** | 30 % of taxable income rebate | Pay to HEC-recognised NGOs → keep receipt → attach in IRIS |
| **Home loan interest** | Full interest amount (house ≤ 2,500 sq ft) | Loan from scheduled bank → submit interest certificate in return |

*Pro move: submit Form 3 to HR by 1 Dec → lower monthly tax, bigger take-home.*

## 🏠 Property tricks (sell/buy smarter)
*   **Be a filer** → Advance Tax 236C halves ( 0.5 % vs 1 % on ≤ Rs 50 M property ).
*   **Hold property > 4 years** → Capital Gains Tax drops significantly (pre-30-Jun-2024 purchase).
*   **Pay via bank** → no cash > Rs 5 M → avoids extra FBR eyeballs.

## 🧑‍💻 Freelancer / side-hustle?
*   **Get NTN** → file return → suddenly you’re a filer on all platforms → lower withholding everywhere.
*   **Tech start-up?** → register with PSEB → 3-year tax holiday (till June 2025).
*   **Export services** → 0 % income tax on foreign receipts (Schedule 1, Part-I) → keep SWIFT proof.

## 🚀 Next 48-hour action
1.  Open FBR IRIS → check filer status ( green tick = cheaper life ).
2.  Collect education fee receipts → email to HR with Form 3.
3.  Pay Zakat online → download receipt → attach in return.
4.  File return before 30 Sep → claim refund if employer deducted extra.

Lock these steps → 2025 you will see a fatter salary slip, not a fatter tax bill.
