Based on the search results, I have direct access to information about checking and paying e-challans for Lahore through an official provincial portal, but less specific guidance for Karachi and Islamabad. The other web pages in the search results provide information about e-challans in India, which are not relevant to Pakistan.

The table below summarizes the verified and general information for each city.

| City | Official Method | Key Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lahore (Punjab)** | Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) portal. | You can check and pay fines online. You need to register and log in with your CNIC on the official website. |
| **Karachi (Sindh)** | Information not found in search. | Likely through the Sindh Police or Karachi Traffic Police website. No official link or direct process was found in the current search results. |
| **Islamabad (Federal)** | Information not found in search. | Likely through the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police or a federal portal. No official link or direct process was found in the current search results. |

## 🔍 How to Check and Pay E-Challans (General Process)
While the specific portals vary, the process for checking and paying e-challans is generally similar across Pakistan. You can expect to follow these steps:

1.  **Find the Official Portal:** Visit the website of the relevant traffic police authority (e.g., Punjab Safe Cities Authority for Lahore, Sindh Police for Karachi).
2.  **Check Your Challan:** Look for a section like "E-Challan," "Traffic Fine," or "Challan Status." You can typically search using your vehicle registration number, CNIC, or a specific challan number.
3.  **View Details and Pay:** The system will show any pending fines with details (date, location, violation). You can then pay online using a credit/debit card, mobile wallet, or bank transfer.
4.  **Save the Receipt:** Always download or save the payment confirmation receipt as proof.

## 📞 How to Find Current Information
To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend these steps:

*   **Use Official Channels:** Search for "[City Name] Traffic Police e-challan" (e.g., "Karachi Traffic Police e-challan") in your search engine and look for official government websites (domains like .gov.pk or .gop.pk).
*   **Check Social Media:** Official Facebook or Twitter pages for city traffic police departments often post announcements and links to their services.
*   **Visit Police Stations:** You can always inquire about or pay fines in person at the nearest traffic police station.
