Finding traditional hotels under a budget of PKR 5,000 (approximately $18 USD) in Islamabad can be challenging, as most established properties are priced higher. Your best options will be well-rated guest houses and hostels.

## Best Budget Options (Likely Under PKR 5,000)
These are the properties most likely to meet your price requirement, often by offering dormitory beds or very small rooms.

| Accommodation Name | Type | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backpackers Hostel & Guest House** | Hostel/Guest House | Consistently listed as one of the cheapest and best-rated hostels (~PKR 3,300 - 4,200). Excellent for solo travelers. |
| **Harvey's Guest House** | Guest House | Known for offering good value for money (~PKR 3,600+). |
| **Local Furnished Rooms** | Private Rental | You can often find private rooms for short-term rent in local guest houses (I-8, Ghauri Town) for PKR 2,500 - 4,500. |
