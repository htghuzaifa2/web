### 🔥 One-week launch checklist
1.  Pick ONE hustle above → open required account (Fiverr / Daraz / Canva).
2.  Create 3 samples → portfolio ready.
3.  Share in 3 WhatsApp groups → **first client usually a friend**.
4.  Deliver fast → ask for review → raise price 20 % next week.

Lock this routine → 2026 you will be earning while others are still asking “yaar, part-time job kahan milegi?”
