## 1. Build a Trustworthy Foundation
The first impression your site gives to the AdSense reviewer is key. You need to look like a professional, established resource, not a quick, throw‑away project.

### Element – Huzi’s Recommendation – Why It Matters
- **Domain**: Use a custom domain (e.g., `.com`, `.pk`). Free subdomains look less professional. A custom domain shows you’re serious.
- **Essential Pages**: About Us, Contact Us, and a Privacy Policy. This proves you are a genuine person/entity and helps establish trust and legal compliance.
- **Navigation**: Simple, clear menus (header and footer). The reviewer needs to find every page easily. Broken links or confusing menus are a common rejection reason.
- **Design**: Use a responsive, mobile‑friendly theme. Most traffic today is mobile. Your site must look perfect and load quickly on a smartphone.
- **Security**: Ensure your site uses HTTPS (SSL Certificate). This is a standard requirement for user trust and web professionalism.

## 2. Focus on High‑Quality Content (The Golden Rule)
This is the most critical step. AdSense calls it having **"unique and interesting content."**
1. **Be Original and Unique** – Never copy or scrape content. Your voice, research, and perspective matter. Even if you cover a popular topic, add your unique Pakistani context or personal reflections.
2. **Write Substantially** – Aim for articles that are genuinely helpful and in‑depth. Successful applications often have posts around 800‑1000 words or more with good detail.
3. **Post Consistently** – Don't apply with only five posts. Aim for 20‑30 high‑quality articles published and indexed on Google before you submit. This shows commitment.
4. **Avoid Prohibited Niches** – Stay away from illegal activities, adult themes, hate speech, copyrighted material, or politically sensitive content that could violate Google’s policies. Choose safe, helpful topics (tech guides, education, travel, lifestyle).

## 3. Generate Legitimate Traffic
While Google doesn’t list a minimum traffic number, real organic visitors show that your content is valuable.
- **Organic is Key** – Share your content on social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) and focus on SEO to attract visitors from Google search.
- **Avoid Invalid Activity** – Never click your own ads, use click‑exchange services, or buy fake/bot traffic. This is an instant disqualifier and can lead to a permanent ban.

## 4. Pakistan‑Specific Application Details
- **Age & Identity**: Must be at least 18 years old. You’ll need a valid Pakistan‑issued ID (CNIC or passport) for verification later.
- **Payment Country**: Select Pakistan as your payment country. Use the exact name that matches your official ID and future bank account; changing this later is very difficult.
- **Patience**: Review can take a few days to a couple of weeks. Keep publishing great content while you wait. If rejected, read the email carefully, fix the issue (e.g., add more content, fix navigation), and reapply.
