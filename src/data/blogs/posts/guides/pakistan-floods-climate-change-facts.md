The link between Pakistan's devastating floods and climate change is a critical and widely reported issue. The catastrophic 2022 Pakistan floods serve as a major case study.

## 1. Pakistan's Extreme Vulnerability
*   **Low Contributor, High Risk:** Pakistan contributes less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is ranked among the top 10 countries worldwide most affected by climate change.
*   **Climate Change as a Factor:** Scientific research indicates that global heating played a substantial role in making events like the 2022 floods up to 50% worse.

## 2. The 2022 Floods: A Catastrophic Event
The 2022 floods are widely considered the worst in Pakistan's history.
*   **Timeframe:** June 2022 – October 2022
*   **Cause:** Heavy monsoon rains, poor urban planning, and climate change.
*   **Affected Population:** Over 33 million people (one in seven Pakistanis).
*   **Fatalities:** 1,760+ deaths, including 647 children.
*   **Damage:** Estimated $40 billion (2022 USD) in property damage and losses.

## 3. How Climate Change Worsens the Floods
*   **Intense Monsoon Rains:** Sindh and Balochistan received drastically higher rainfall (784% and 500% more than average) in Aug 2022.
*   **Warming Indian Ocean:** A warming ocean increases the intensity and duration of monsoon rainfall.
*   **Heatwaves and Glacial Melting:** Record-setting heatwaves preceded the floods, creating a thermal low that drew in rain and triggering Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in Gilgit-Baltistan.

## 4. Broader Climate Impacts in Pakistan
*   **Increased Frequency of Extremes:** frequent heatwaves, droughts, and cyclones.
*   **Economic Impact:** The 2022 floods destroyed around 50% of the country's crops, impacting the agriculture-dependent economy.
*   **Long-Term Trends:** Annual mean temperature has increased by ~0.63°C over the past century, and sea levels along Karachi are rising by ~1.1mm per year.
