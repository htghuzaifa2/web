Below are zero-equipment, low-data workouts you can smash in a 6-by-6 hostel room—no gym shoes, no fancy supplements, just your body, a mat, and the will to survive the next power cut.

## 🕒 Daily 20-Minute Circuit (No Equipment)

| Exercise | Duration | Rep Count | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jumping Jacks** | 1 min | non-stop | warm-up, raises heart rate |
| **Body-weight Squats** | 1 min | 20-25 reps | use backpack for extra load |
| **Counter Push-ups** | 1 min | 15-20 reps | hands on bed edge if floor is dirty |
| **Walking Lunges** | 1 min | 20 reps | hallway or between bunk beds |
| **Mountain Climbers** | 1 min | fast pace | core + cardio in one move |

*Repeat circuit 2 rounds → 20 min total → sweat guaranteed, data bundle safe.*

## 📅 Weekly Hostel-Friendly Plan
*   **Monday** → Upper body (push-ups, counter dips, backpack rows)
*   **Tuesday** → Lower body (squats, lunges, calf raises)
*   **Wednesday** → Core & Cardio (mountain climbers, plank, jumping jacks)
*   **Thursday** → Yoga stretch (follow Amafah Mubashir on IG @amafahmubashir)
*   **Friday** → Full-body HIIT (repeat daily circuit ×3)
*   **Saturday** → Active recovery (light walk to canteen)
*   **Sunday** → Rest (or more chai)

## 🎒 Backpack = Dumbbell Hack
*   **Backpack rows** → fill with books → pull towards chest → lat builder.
*   **Overhead press** → raise bag above head → shoulder burner.
*   **Bicep curls** → hold straps, curl bag → gun-show ready.

## 🧘 Stretch & Cool-down (2 min)
*   **Child’s pose** → 30 sec → lower-back release.
*   **Pigeon pose** → 30 sec/side → hip opener (great after squats).
*   **Diaphragmatic breathing** → 10 deep breaths → parasympathetic reset.

## 📲 Follow-along Accounts (Free)
*   **Mustafa Jamshed** (IG @mustafajamshed) → upper-body workouts with water-bottle weights.
*   **Hydro** (YouTube) → leg-day killers, no equipment.
*   **Mehak Taherani** (YouTube) → full-body Friday burners.

### 🔥 One-Week Kick-start
1.  Tonight → save this post, set alarm 7 a.m.
2.  Tomorrow → do the 20-min circuit → tick on calendar.
3.  Share in hostel WhatsApp group → mutual shame = motivation.
4.  Repeat for 7 days → body feels lighter, brain feels sharper, chai tastes better.

Lock this routine → 2025 you will be the “fit guy” in the common-room before the next power-cut.
