The history of the rivalry is defined by long periods of hiatus and dramatic resumptions, dictated by political relations.

## History and Political Intertwining
*   **The Beginning (1952):** Pakistan received Test status in 1952 and played its first Test series against India, hosted by India. This marked the official start of the rivalry.
*   **The Hiatuses:** The two major wars between the nations in 1965 and 1971 caused cricket ties to be suspended for over a decade (1962 to 1977). Cricket has always served as a barometer for bilateral relations, resuming during periods of diplomatic warming (e.g., in 1978 and 2004) and being suspended during times of high tension.
*   **Cricket Diplomacy (2004):** The most famous resumption occurred in 2004 when India toured Pakistan for the first time in 14 years. This tour, initiated as a peace process, was lauded globally as an example of cricket diplomacy and led to a brief, beautiful period of bilateral tours.
*   **The Modern Era:** Since 2007, bilateral series (home and away tours) have largely stopped due to geopolitical strains. Today, the teams only meet in multi-nation tournaments governed by the ICC (World Cups, Champions Trophy) and the ACC (Asia Cup), guaranteeing limited, but high-stakes, encounters.

## 📊 Head-to-Head Statistics (As of late 2025)

### The ICC Tournament Anomaly
The rivalry intensifies the most in ICC events, where India holds a near-unbeatable record against Pakistan.

## 🌟 The Biggest & Most Memorable Matches
The rivalry is defined by moments of individual brilliance, high drama, and iconic clashes on neutral soil (Sharjah and ICC venues).

*   **Austral-Asia Cup Final, Sharjah (1986):** Javed Miandad hits a six off the last ball from Chetan Sharma, securing an iconic one-wicket win. This cemented Sharjah as Pakistan's "backyard" for a decade and a half.
*   **World Cup Quarter-Final, Bangalore (1996):** Aamir Sohail hits Venkatesh Prasad for a boundary and gestures aggressively. On the next ball, Prasad bowls Sohail and points him back to the pavilion—an iconic moment of retaliation.
*   **World T20 Final, Johannesburg (2007):** A young Indian team defeats Pakistan by 5 runs in the inaugural T20 World Cup final. The final catch by Sreesanth off Misbah-ul-Haq's scoop is unforgettable.
*   **World Cup Semi-Final, Mohali (2011):** A match with immense diplomatic weight (attended by both PMs). India won the highly-charged match, cementing their ODI World Cup dominance.
*   **T20 World Cup, Melbourne (2022):** Virat Kohli's match-winning 82 not out, specifically the two sixes off Haris Rauf in the 19th over, is widely regarded as one of the greatest T20 innings ever played.
