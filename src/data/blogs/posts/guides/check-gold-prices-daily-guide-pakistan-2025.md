Below is the hostel-room friendly guide to tracking gold daily and understanding what those numbers mean before you buy/sell.

## 🔎 Step 1: Where to Check Daily (Free & Live)

| Platform | URL | Update Speed | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kitco** | kitco.com/gold | Every 5 seconds | Works on 2G, no sign-up |
| **BullionByPost** | bullionbypost.com/gold-price | Every 5 seconds | No account needed, live chart |
| **Markets Insider** | markets.businessinsider.com/gold | Real-time | Live chart + historical data |

*Bookmark one site – check at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM (when LBMA sets the daily benchmark).*

## 📊 Step 2: What the Numbers Mean (Hostel Translation)

| Term | What It Means | Buyer Tip |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spot Price** | Price to buy/sell gold right now | Use this for jewelry, coins, small bars |
| **LBMA Price** | Daily benchmark set at 10:30 AM & 3:00 PM GMT | Use this for long-term tracking |
| **Troy Ounce** | 31.1 grams (not 28.3 g) | Jewelry shops quote in grams – divide by 31.1 for oz price |
| **Bid vs Ask** | Bid = what dealer pays you, Ask = what you pay dealer | Lower spread = cheaper to buy/sell |

## 💡 Step 3: What It Means for You (Buyer Tips)
*   **If spot price < ₹ 4,300/oz** → buying jewelry is cheaper today (as of 16 Dec 2025).
*   **If price drops 2 days in a row** → wait 1 more day – jewelry shops often lag by 24 hrs.
*   **If price spikes > ₹ 4,400/oz** → sell old jewelry, buy back later.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** bookmark Kitco → check at 10:30 AM tomorrow.
2.  **Tomorrow:** note the price → compare with yesterday.
3.  **Weekend:** check 3-day trend → buy/sell accordingly.
4.  **Next week:** set price alert (Kitco → “Alert > ₹ 4,400”) → get SMS when price spikes.

Lock this routine → 2025 you will be the “guy who bought gold before the price spike” while others still hunt for the correct URL.
