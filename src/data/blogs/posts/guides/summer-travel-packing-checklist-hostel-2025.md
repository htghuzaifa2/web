Below is the zero-rupee, 2G-friendly checklist that turns “I forgot my charger” into “I’m the travel guru of the dorm”—all tested on a Rs 28k stipend and hostel Wi-Fi that dies at 2 a.m.

## 🧳 Core Packing List (Hostel-Bed to Beach)

| Category | What to Pack | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Documents** | CNIC + 2 copies, boarding pass screenshots, travel insurance PDF | Save screenshots in WhatsApp (works offline) |
| **Clothing** | 4 neutral tees, 2 flowy shorts, 1 light jacket, 7 underwear, 1 quick-dry towel | Pick quick-dry fabric → washes in bucket, dries overnight |
| **Footwear** | Birkenstock sandals (all-day comfort), light sneakers (exploring) | Break-in sandals 1 week before → no hostel blisters |
| **Tech** | 20,000 mAh power-bank, wireless earbuds, USB-C cable, laptop sleeve | Power-bank = hostel life-support |
| **Toiletries** | Solid shampoo bar, sunscreen, natural deodorant, toothbrush + paste | Solid bars = no liquid faff at airport |
| **Money** | JazzCash/QR card, small cash, screenshot of travel card | QR card = pay hostel rent without cash hunt |

## 🎒 Hostel-Specific Add-Ons
*   **Portable Wi-Fi dongle** → hostel Wi-Fi dies at 2 a.m. → you still submit assignments.
*   **Noise-cancelling earbuds** → block uncle-snoring during 8 a.m. Zoom.
*   **Reusable water bottle** → refill at hostel cooler → no single-use plastic guilt.
*   **Emergency deodorant** → carry-on friendly, aluminum-based → long travel days.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** download boarding pass screenshots → save in WhatsApp.
2.  **Weekend:** wash & pack clothes → roll, don’t fold → saves space.
3.  **Departure day:** charge power-bank, wear Birkenstocks, carry reusable bottle → you’re ready.

Lock this list → 2025 you will be the “guy who always has a charger” while others still hunt for change.
