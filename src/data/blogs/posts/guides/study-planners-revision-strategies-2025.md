I’ve survived four semesters on a Rs 28k Samsung and a room-mate who thinks “study time” = “speaker time”. Below are the planners & tactics that still got me 80 % averages – useful stuff first, my ego later.

## 1. Google Calendar Time-Blocking (free, offline)
*   Open Calendar → Week view → drag 2-hour blocks for each subject.
*   Colour code: red = core subject, blue = optional, grey = break.
*   Set reminder 10 min before → phone buzzes, you move, no negotiation.
*   *Hostel hack: share calendar link with study buddy → mutual shame if you skip.*

## 2. Pomodoro 25-5 with hostel twist
*   25 min focus → 5 min break → repeat 4 cycles → 30 min long break.
*   **Break rule:** stand up, walk to canteen, no phone scrolling → brain resets faster.
*   **App:** Forest (free) → plant dies if you unlock → instant guilt motivation.

## 3. Eisenhower Matrix on paper (because phone dies)
Draw four boxes on A4:

| Urgent | Not Urgent |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Do now (today)** | **Plan (this week)** |
| **Delegate (group task)** | **Delete (optional readings)** |

*Fill nightly → next morning you know exactly what to open first.*

## 4. Spaced Revision without apps
*   Day 1: learn → Day 2: quick recap → Day 4: past-paper questions → Day 7: teach friend.
*   **Use WhatsApp:** send voice-note summary to yourself → listen during walk to cafeteria → free recall practice.

## 5. Past-Paper First Policy
*   Before opening book: attempt last 3-year questions → mark unknown bits → study only those.
*   *Result: < 50 % syllabus covers > 80 % marks → hostel Wi-Fi survives longer.*

## 6. Weekly Planner printable (stick on wall)
**Template (copy-hand):**
*   Mon: Micro-econ 2-4 pm | Break 4-4:30 | Stats 4:30-6
*   Tue: Law past-paper 9-11 | Break | AI assignment 11:30-1
*   Wed: REST / group study
*   *Green tick after each block → visual dopamine keeps you going.*

## 7. Exam Countdown Google Sheets
*   Column A: Topic | B: Pages left | C: Days left | D: Pages/day
*   Formula: `=B2/C2` → auto-calculates daily target → no last-night panic.

## 8. Break Rules (or you break)
*   **Micro-break:** 5 push-ups → blood rush → brain wakes up.
*   **Macro-break:** Sunday afternoon = movie + biryani → reset without guilt.

## Quick starter routine (copy-paste)
1.  Tonight: block tomorrow in Calendar
2.  Morning: past-paper first → note unknowns
3.  Study: Pomodoro 25-5 → voice-note summary
4.  Weekly: tick planner wall → green = dopamine
5.  Sunday: biryani reward → repeat next week

Stick to this for 14 days → grades rise, stress drops, room-mate still plays speaker, but you don’t care.
