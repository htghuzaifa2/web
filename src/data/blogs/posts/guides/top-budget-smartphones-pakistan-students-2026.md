I still remember the semester I survived on a Rs 22,000 scholarship refund and still needed a phone that could run Google Classroom without freezing.
Below are the 2026 models that tick those boxes under Rs 30,000 – prices I double-checked on Daraz last night.

## 1. Infinix Smart 10 5G – “5G for the price of a textbook”
**Price:** Rs 22,699 (4 + 64 GB)
*   **Why:** 5G modem inside a 5000 mAh battery.
*   **Campus hack:** Download lectures at the 5G tower in 5 mins.

## 2. Tecno Spark 40 – “128 GB storage, zero wallet tears”
**Price:** Rs 30,620 (6 + 128 GB)
*   **Highlights:** 128 GB (no SD hunt), 50 MP AI camera scans notes clearly.
*   **Bonus:** Type-C port.

## 3. Infinix Hot 40i – “Looks glass, costs plastic”
