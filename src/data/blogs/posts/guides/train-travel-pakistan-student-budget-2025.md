I’ve ridden the rails from Peshawar to Karachi on a Rs 1,300 ticket. Below are the hacks that turn a long-haul into a mini-holiday.

## 1. Pick the right train
| Route | Train | Time | Fare (AC Sleeper) | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LHR → KHI** | Green Line | 20 hrs | Rs 4,800 | Fastest, cleanest |
| **LHR → KHI** | Pak Business | 22 hrs | Rs 4,200 | Free meals |
| **RWP → LHR** | Margalla Exp | 4.5 hrs | Rs 700 (AC Std) | Morning departure |

## 2. Pack like a desi scout
*   **Power-bank:** 20,000 mAh essential.
*   **Bedding:** Twin-sheet + pillow (washing quality varies).
*   **Food:** Home-cooked paratha-achar (safest).
*   **Hygiene:** Sanitizer + toilet paper.
*   **Cable:** 3-metre cable for upper berths.

## 3. Seat / berth selection hacks
*   **Lower berth (side):** Window + plug access.
*   **Cabin 1 or 7:** Quieter.
*   **Families:** Book whole cabin regarding privacy.

## 4. Food strategy
*   **Samosas:** Only if steaming hot.
*   **Chai:** Ask for "khoya wala".
*   **Avoid:** Uncovered raitas & ice-water.

## 5. Safety & comfort
*   **Money belt:** Inside shalwar.
*   **Luggage:** Label with WhatsApp number.
*   **Sleep:** Use backpack as pillow.

## 6. Capture the journey
*   Clean window before shooting sunrise.
*   Slow-mo tunnel entries.
*   Time-lapse chai cups.

## 7. Stretch & move
Walk the length of the train every 2 hrs.

## 8. Disembark like a pro
Pack 30 mins early. Keep small notes for porters.

Final sip: train travel is a lived experience. Enjoy the stories and the sunset over the Sindh desert.
