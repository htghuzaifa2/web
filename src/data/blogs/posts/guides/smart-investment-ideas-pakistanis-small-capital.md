## 1. The Simplest Entry: Mutual Funds
Mutual funds let you pool money with thousands of others, giving diversification without needing expertise. In Pakistan, platforms like UBL Funds, HBL Asset Management, and Meezan Bank let you start with as little as PKR 500‑1,000 via digital apps.

### Low‑Risk Options
- **Money Market Funds** – stable, modest returns, ideal for parking emergency funds.
- **Income Funds** – aim for regular income, slightly higher risk than money‑market.

### Shariah‑Compliant Options
Most major AMCs offer Islamic funds that follow Shariah principles, perfect for many investors.

## 2. The Traditional Safe Harbor: Gold
Gold remains a trusted hedge against inflation.

- **Physical Gold** – buy small gram bars or coins monthly; watch storage costs.
- **Digital Gold / Gold ETFs** – buy fractions online, no safekeeping worries.

## 3. Owning a Piece of the Market: Stocks (PSX)
The Pakistan Stock Exchange is more accessible than ever.

- **Start Small** – open an account with a licensed broker; you can buy a single share, sometimes under PKR 500.
- **Focus on Dividends** – blue‑chip companies with regular payouts provide steady passive income.
- **Long‑Term Mindset** – treat stocks as a 5‑year+ investment; ignore short‑term volatility.

## 4. Investing in Yourself: Skill‑Based Ventures
Often the best ROI is in your own abilities.

- **Digital Skills** – spend PKR 5,000‑10,000 on courses (digital marketing, design, web dev).
- **Online Business** – start dropshipping or a niche e‑commerce store; initial costs are mainly hosting and minimal inventory.

Consistent, small investments compound over time, turning modest capital into substantial wealth.
