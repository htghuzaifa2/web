In Pakistan, sandwiches aren’t just quick snacks — they’re a canvas for creativity. From classic Desi twists to fusion ideas, here are some popular choices worth making at home:

## 🧆 1. Bun Kebab Sandwich (Classic Desi Street Style)
A legendary treat. Spiced patty (shami kebab + egg) inside a soft bun with chutney and onions.
*   **Make it at home:** Use soft buns, spicy kebab patty, egg, chutney, and extra masala.

## 🥪 2. Chicken Club Sandwich (Café Style)
Layers of spiced chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, omelette, and cheese.
*   **Twist idea:** Add a slather of green chutney along with mayo for a Desi fusion vibe!

## 🍗 3. Tikka Fried Sandwich
Bread stuffed with shredded tikka‑spiced chicken, dipped in egg, coated with crumbs, and lightly fried.
*   **Great for:** Evening tea time snacks.

## 🍕 4. Pizza Sandwich (Ramzan & Everyday Fun)
Gooey cheese, chicken tikka bits, capsicum, olives, and pizza sauce stuffed between slices.
*   **How I like it:** Toast it with butter on a skillet until crispy.

## 🥑 5. Chutney Sandwich
Simplicity is key. Green chutney, thin cucumber, and mayo.
*   **Tip:** Add chaat masala and lemon to amplify flavors.

## 🍔 6. Fusion Burgers (Chapli & Desi Patties)
Chapli kabab burgers — where the spiced Peshawari patty becomes the hero.
*   **Make it fun:** Add mint‑yogurt sauce or tamarind chutney instead of ketchup.

## 🥪 7. Anday Wala Burger & Protein Bomb Sandwiches
Panini grilled melts with herby chicken, gooey cheese, and spicy mayo are becoming popular cafe lunch choices.

## 🌮 8. Global Fusion Ideas Making Waves
*   **Tikka tacos:** Local grill spices meet Mexican tortillas.
*   **Biryani pizza / Butter chicken pasta.**
*   **Samosa burgers & naan wraps.**

### 🍽️ My Personal Twist Tips
What I really enjoy is taking simple ideas and mixing local spices — tikka masala, chaat masala — with global formats. A toasted sandwich with Cilantro chutney + mozzarella is innovation at its best.

*And if you’re planning a small get‑together, these sandwiches are easy and fun to make without spending too much time.*
