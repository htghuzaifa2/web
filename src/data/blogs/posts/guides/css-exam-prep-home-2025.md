(for students stuck in hostel rooms or on a tight budget)

## 1. Download the official map first
Grab the FPSC syllabus PDF (2025). Pick optional subjects based on interest, not "scoring myths".

## 2. Collect the real past papers (free)
Download last 5-year papers. Analyze patterns and word limits.

## 3. Turn your room into a CSS factory
Remove distractions. Use a whiteboard for targets. Good lighting + chair are essential.

## 4. Daily timetable (hostel-friendly)
*   **06:00 – 07:00:** Dawn editorial + vocab.
*   **08:00 – 10:30:** Subject 1 (Notes).
*   **11:00 – 13:00:** Subject 2 (Past papers).
*   **14:00 – 16:00:** Essay/Precis practice.
*   **20:00 – 22:00:** Revise/MCQs.
*   **Total:** 6-8 hrs/day. Sunday half-day off.

## 5. Free / cheap resources (PKR friendly)
*   **Dawn e-paper:** Student pack.
*   **YouTube:** CSS with Usman, Nearpeer.
*   **PDF books:** Compress via **tool.huzi.pk**.

## 6. Writing practice = daily push-ups
*   1 essay outline/intro daily.
*   1 précis alternate days.
*   Peer review in WhatsApp groups.

## 7. Mock tests = exam vaccination
Monthly mock tests in exam mode (3 hrs, no phone).

## 8. Motivation hacks
*   Sticky-note wall: "Why I want to be a CSP".
*   Weekly "chai call" with a senior.

### 9. When you feel stuck
Don't switch subjects; re-read or watch a video. Take micro-breaks.
Remember: every CSP once studied in pajamas. Consistency > intensity.
