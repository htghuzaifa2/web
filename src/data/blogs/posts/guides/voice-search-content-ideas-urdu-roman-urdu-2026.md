## 1. Think “friend on call”, not “robot on page”
Voice queries are chatty. Write how you speak.
*   **Typed:** "best biryani Karachi"
*   **Voice:** “Karachi mein best biryani kahan mile gi aaj?”

## 2. FAQ = Voice Snippet Gold
Create a dedicated FAQ section.
*   **Q:** “Lahore mein student hostel monthly rent kitna hai?”
*   **A:** “Lahore mein student hostel ka average monthly rent 8 se 12 hazar rupees hai, mess charges alag.”
Add FAQPage Schema.

## 3. Roman-Urdu filler words
Include casual fillers (“Like”, “so”, “actually”) in Q/A to match speech patterns.

## 4. Local + “near me” = voice magnet
76% of voice searches have local intent. Sprinkle city names and landmarks.
*   “Best ‘sehri’ buffet near Gulshan-e-Iqbal Karachi”

## 5. Micro-content types that win
*   **How-to:** “How to compress image for LMS upload...”
*   **Comparison:** “Online b.a. vs traditional b.a...”
*   **Listicle:** “5 hostel-friendly exercises...”
*   **Weather:** “Is it gonna rain in Lahore tomorrow...”

## 6. Speakable Schema
Wrap key paragraphs in `SpeakableSpecification` JSON schema for Google Assistant.

## 7. Speed & mobile
Voice queries hit mobile. Ensure page loads < 2s on 4G.

## 8. Content calendar idea – June 2026
*   Week 1: “Ramadan ‘sehri’ times in Lahore...”
*   Week 2: “Best ‘iftar’ deals under Rs 500...”
*   Week 3: “Productive Ramadan student guide...”

Keep tone casual and answers short. Google will pick your words when someone asks their phone while driving on GT Road.
