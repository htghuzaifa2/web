Below is the zero-rupee cheat-sheet that turns “Why is my premium so high?” into “I just saved ₹ 3,000 and still have coverage”—all tested on hostel Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## 🔍 Step 1: Understand What Drives Your Premium
*   **PMT Score (Poverty Means Test)** → lower score = lower premium.
*   **Driving Record** → zero accidents = zero premium hikes.
*   **Car Value** → older car = drop collision/comprehensive if value < 10× premium.
*   **Location** → urban area = higher risk = higher premium.
