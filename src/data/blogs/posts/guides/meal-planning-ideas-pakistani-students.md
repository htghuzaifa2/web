Being a student in Pakistan can be exciting, but it also means juggling classes and sometimes a tight budget. Simple meal planning can save time, money, and stress.

## 1. Plan for the Week
Start with a small weekly plan:
*   List meals for each day.
*   Include easy snacks.
*   **Tip:** Planning prevents last-minute expensive deliveries.

## 2. Affordable Breakfast Ideas
*   Paratha with yogurt and fruit.
*   Oatmeal with milk/water + nuts.
*   Egg sandwich or boiled eggs.
*   **Time:** 5–10 mins prep.

## 3. Budget-Friendly Lunch Options
*   **Daal Chawal:** Easy to cook in bulk.
*   **Vegetable Pulao:** Nutritious and cheap.
*   **Wraps:** Leftover chicken + salad in roti.

## 4. Quick Dinner Ideas
*   Stir-fried vegetables with rice/noodles.
*   Grilled chicken/fish with salad.
*   Vegetable omelette with roti.

## 5. Healthy Snacks on Campus
*   Mixed nuts, roasted chickpeas.
*   Fresh fruit (bananas, apples).
*   Yogurt or lassi.
*   **Tip:** Avoid frequent fried snacks.

## 6. Batch Cooking & Storage
*   Cook 2–3 days of meals at once.
*   Store in airtight containers in the fridge.
*   Label meals by day.

## 7. Hydration & Mindful Eating
*   Drink water frequently.
*   Eat without rushing to improve digestion.
