TL;DR: Bong paya is the new breakfast flex, chaat gets a tamarind glow-up, and kulfi is still king—only now it’s denser, drier, and costs 100 PKR a pop.

## 🇵🇰 What’s HOT on the streets right now

| Dish | Karachi Twist | Lahore Twist | Why it’s trending |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bong & Paya** | — | Winter-only breakfast (3 days/week) | Bone-marrow richness = desi protein shake |
| **Chana Chaat** | Tamarind + mint + 3-chutney overload | Same combo, Shah Alam stall | Sweet-sour-spicy explosion in 100 PKR bowl |
| **Kulfi** | Dense, dry, fibre-rich (5× less water) | Baba Kulfi Wala recipe (3rd gen) | Almost chalky texture = new texture flex |
| **Paratha Rolls** | Spicy chicken + chutney wrap | Amritsari-style + extra butter | Grab-and-go meals for commuters |
| **Kinnow Juice** | Fresh-squeezed @ Rs 60/glass | Same citrus, cart culture | Vitamin C + sweet-sour kick in winter |

## 🌡️ Seasonal hacks you’ll see
*   **Winter mornings** = paya & nihari only – vendors open 6-9 a.m., shut by 11.
*   **Evening** = chaat + kulfi – carts light up after Maghrib, crowds peak 8-10 p.m.
*   **Prices locked:** chaat ₹100, kulfi ₹100, kinnow juice ₹60 – same across both cities.

## 📍 Where the action is
*   **Karachi:** Burns Road (biryani + nihari), Boat Basin (paratha rolls), Do Darya (sea-view + kebabs).
*   **Lahore:** Gawalmandi (chaat + kulfi), Shah Alam (chaat dynasty), Fort Road (fusion karahi).

## 🔥 Micro-trends to watch
*   **Fusion karahi** (cheddar + cream) popping up in Fort Road, Lahore.
*   **Food-truck parks** (Burger Lab, Wok This Way) creeping into Lahore & Karachi.
*   **Kinnow** (local citrus) juice outselling orange because it’s sweeter + cheaper.

**Bottom line:** winter 2025-26 = bone-marrow breakfasts, triple-sauce chaats, and dense milk ice that feels like chalk — and we’re here for it.
