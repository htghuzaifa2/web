I still remember the 2023 World Cup game where Pakistan fielded like they were using a 1990’s floppy disk. Fast-forward to late 2025, and the huddle kept glancing at a tablet showing real-time shot maps.
Below is the short, student-friendly rundown of how data is finally entering the Pakistan dressing room.

## 1. Dot-ball obsession – the new currency
*   **Study:** Winning teams average 38 dot balls/innings, losers 45.
*   **Strategy:** Targeting < 6 dot-balls in middle overs (7-15).
*   **Outcome:** 13% drop in win probability for every extra dot-ball conceded.

## 2. Toss is no longer king
*   **Data:** Pakistan’s win-rate difference between win-toss & lose-toss is minimal.
*   **Focus:** Match-ups over coin flips.
*   **Result:** Won T20 series vs England despite losing 4/5 tosses.

## 3. AI-powered weakness radar
*   **Tool:** CricViz + ML models predict shot patterns.
*   **Example:** Shaheen bowled a wide yorker to SKY based on a 68% scoop probability, getting him caught.

## 4. Real-time fitness & workload chips
*   **Tech:** GPS + heart-rate vests.
*   **Action:** Naseem lowered intensity when data showed red-zone fatigue, avoiding injury.

## 5. Power-play split – data says attack early
*   **Old:** Save main bowler for death.
*   **New:** Shaheen & Rauf bowl 3 each inside first 8 overs. PP average wickets jumped from 1 to 2.

## 6. Batting order by numbers
*   **Insight:** Iftikhar promoted to No. 4 vs spin-heavy sides due to 145 SR vs off-spin.

## 7. What still lags behind
*   Fielding positioning is still manual.
*   Domestic circuit lacks ball-tracking data.
*   Political interference slows institutional memory.

### 🧠 Quick takeaway for fans
Next time you see Babar staring at an iPad, know an algorithm just told him “bowl slower bumper next – 38% chance of dot-ball.” Data won’t hit the six, but it shows where to place the fielder who catches it.
