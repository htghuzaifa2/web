I’ve spent nights where my brain felt like a Google Chrome tab explosion. Below are the tiny, real-world habits that helped me stay functional.

## 1. Three-Breath Rule before “Copy-Paste”
Close eyes, inhale 3s, exhale 3s, repeat thrice. Takes 9 seconds. Resets dopamine.

## 2. Hostel-Friendly “Pomodoro”
25 min study, 5 min chai. Four cycles = 2 hours. Reward: one YouTube Shorts scroll.

## 3. Sunday “Digital Sunset”
Sunday 6 p.m. to Monday 6 a.m. – no client mails. Enable “Do Not Disturb”.
Use “scheduled send” for Monday morning replies.

## 4. “Chai-Call”
Once a week audio call to a friend. Rule: no work talk for first 5 mins.

## 5. 2-Minute Journal
Night before sleep:
1.  One thing I finished.
2.  One thing bugging me.
3.  One tiny win tomorrow.

## 6. “UPS-Breath” during power cuts
When UPS beeps → stand and stretch. Mimics power-down for nervous system.

## 7. “Money Monday”
Monday 9 a.m.: Check bank balance, list 3 expected payments. Prevents midnight panic.

## 8. Micro-movement
Wall push-ups while kettle boils. Neck rolls between Zoom classes.

## 9. “Safe-word” for family groups
Drop a code emoji (🛑) in family group when deadline storm hits to reduce interruptions.

## 10. Professional help
*   **UMang Clinic:** Student sessions Rs 500.
*   **Rozan helpline:** 0800-22444 (free).
*   **Aga Khan tele-psychiatry:** Insurance friendly.

### 🛠️ Tiny tools
*   **Calm-app:** 3-min breathing.
*   **tool.huzi.pk:** Image compressor for LMS uploads (saves panic).
*   **Google Keep:** Voice notes for 2 a.m. ideas.

### Closing chai sip
