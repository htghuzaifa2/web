This circuit is designed to hit all major muscle groups and get your heart rate up, all in the space of a yoga mat.

## 1. Warm-Up (5 Minutes)
Never skip this step! It prepares your body and prevents injuries. Perform each movement for 30 seconds.
*   **Marching in Place / High Knees:** Gently lift your knees toward your chest.
*   **Arm Circles:** Swing arms forward and backward (15 seconds each way).
*   **Torso Twists:** Stand with feet wide and gently twist your upper body from side to side.
*   **Bodyweight Squats (Light):** Perform slow, shallow squats to wake up your legs.
*   **Jumping Jacks (Low-Impact Option):** Step one foot out at a time, raising your arms (called a "stepping jack").

## 2. The Main Circuit (20 Minutes)
Perform each exercise for 45 seconds, followed by 15 seconds of rest. Complete all 5 exercises to finish one round (5 minutes). Repeat the entire circuit 3-4 times.

| Exercise | Focuses On | Beginner Modification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Bodyweight Squats** | Legs (Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings) | Reduce the depth of the squat, or hold onto a sturdy chair/wall for support. |
| **2. Push-Ups** | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps, Core | Perform on your knees instead of your toes, or do them against a wall or table (called Incline Push-Ups). |
| **3. Plank** | Core (Abs, Lower Back) | Drop down onto your knees while keeping your back straight and core tight. |
| **4. Reverse Lunges (Alternating)** | Legs (Quads, Glutes), Balance | Do not lunge as deep, or simply perform static lunges (lunge on one side for 45 seconds, then switch sides for the next round). |
| **5. Mountain Climbers** | Core, Cardio | Slow the pace down, or perform them as a Plank with Knee Taps (bringing one knee up to the chest slowly). |

## 3. Cool-Down & Stretch (5 Minutes)
Slowly lower your heart rate and hold these stretches for 30-45 seconds each:
*   **Quad Stretch:** Stand and pull one heel toward your glute, holding a wall for balance.
*   **Hamstring Stretch:** Sit on the floor with one leg straight, and reach toward your toes.
*   **Shoulder/Triceps Stretch:** Raise one arm over your head, bend your elbow, and use the other hand to pull the elbow gently down your back.
*   **Child's Pose:** Kneel on the floor, fold your torso forward, and rest your forehead on the ground with arms stretched out.

### 💡 Tips for Sticking to Your Routine
*   **Focus on Consistency:** Aim for 3-4 workouts per week. It's better to do 15 minutes consistently than to attempt one huge workout and quit.
*   **Schedule It:** Treat your workout time like a doctor's appointment. Put it in your phone calendar and stick to it.
*   **Use YouTube:** The best "equipment" you have is the internet! Search for full-length, follow-along videos like "No Equipment Full Body HIIT" or "Yoga for Beginners."
*   **Listen to Your Body:** If a movement causes sharp pain, stop immediately and use a modification. Prioritize form over speed or reps.
