### Key Takeaway for Parents
When choosing a school, the "honest review" must be filtered by your priorities:
*   **For Academic Rigor and International Placement:** Look at KGS (Karachi), LGS (Lahore), and The Lyceum (Karachi).
*   **For Co-Curricular and Holistic Development:** Look at Beaconhouse (if the specific branch is good), Bay View, and the Roots/Millennium systems (known for technology and robotics).
*   **For Tradition and Discipline:** Look at Aitchison (Lahore) and the older missionary schools like St. Patrick's or Convent of Jesus and Mary.

**Before committing, it's highly recommended to visit the specific branch you are considering, as branch quality is often more important than the brand name.**
