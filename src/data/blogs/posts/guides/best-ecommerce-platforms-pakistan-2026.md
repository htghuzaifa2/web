Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how online selling in Pakistan has changed. 2026 looks especially exciting for anyone wanting to start an e-commerce business. Here are the platforms that stand out.

## 1. Shopify – Smooth & International
Shopify is still a favorite. It feels smooth—from setup to payments.
*   **Why I recommend it:** Clean interface, scalable, and good for sellers planning to expand internationally. It now integrates better with local payment gateways.

## 2. Daraz.pk – Local Giant
Daraz remains one of the biggest names. It offers instant visibility to millions of daily visitors.
*   **Tip:** Focus on high-quality images and detailed descriptions to stand out.

## 3. WooCommerce – Flexible & Affordable
If you want full control, WooCommerce (a WordPress plugin) is great.
*   **Pro tip:** Pair it with local shipping plugins to make delivery seamless within Pakistan. It's great for creative entrepreneurs who want their store to feel personal.

## 4. HumariShop / Local Marketplaces
Smaller, Pakistan-focused platforms like HumariShop cater specifically to local sellers, simplifying payments and logistics.
*   **Why it works:** Easy onboarding, familiar payment methods, and direct support.

## 5. Etsy – For Unique & Handmade Goods
Perfect for selling handmade or unique items to a global audience.
*   **Note:** Requires strong product photography and keyword usage to reach international buyers.

### A Few Thoughts
The best platform depends on your goals.
*   *International audience?* Go with **Shopify** or **Etsy**.
*   *Local reach?* **Daraz** or **HumariShop**.
*   *Full control?* **WooCommerce**.

The key is simplicity and trust. Choose a tool that makes selling easy so you can focus on your products.
