I was sitting in the LUMS café last week, and I realised the only apps that really help me are the ones that stay calm when the 4G turns into 2G. Below are the ones I keep installed on my budget Samsung.

## 📚 Study Apps (offline-first, Urdu-friendly)
*   **Taleemabad:** Urdu & English, cached videos. Great for explaining concepts.
*   **MyStudyLife:** Offline timetable/homework. Syncs when you hit Wi-Fi.
*   **Ilm Ki Dunya:** Past papers, MCQs.
*   **Google Keep:** Check-lists, voice notes.
*   **Brainly:** Scan math questions, get answers.

## 🎯 Focus & Productivity Apps (low-data)
*   **Forest:** Plant a tree to stay focused.
*   **PDF Reader (OfficeSuite):** Opens heavy books without lag, night mode.
*   **Notion:** Offline workspace for notes and tasks.
*   **Todoist:** Natural language reminders ("Assignment every Friday").
*   **RescueTime:** Tracks usage to shame you into focus.

## 🧠 Research & AI Boosters
*   **Perplexity:** Direct answers + citations. Use "Academic" mode.
*   **Gemini (Google AI):** Real-time search, speaks roman Urdu.
*   **Poe:** Access multiple models (Claude, ChatGPT).

## 🛠️ Quick utility belt
*   **Offline Dictionary (Urdu Lughat):** No ads, OCR works.
*   **Simple Scan:** Turns notes into small PDF.
*   **tool.huzi.pk:** My own stash—PDF merger, image compressor—loads on 2G.

### Calm closing thought
Start with ONE app this week. Master it, then add the next. A cluttered phone is like a messy study desk.
And if you ever discover a new gem that survives our voltage fluctuations, drop me a DM. Happy studying!
