Building a budget that truly works for a middle-income family in Pakistan means creating a practical plan that withstands inflation and manages essential costs.

## 📊 The Core Budget Framework: The 50/30/20 Rule (Adjusted)
A classic rule is to allocate 50% to Needs, 30% to Wants, and 20% to Savings/Debt. In Pakistan, a more realistic template is:

| Category | Ideal Allocation | Adjusted for PK Realities | Includes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Needs** | 50% | 55-65% | Rent, utilities, groceries, fees, transport. |
| **Wants** | 30% | 20-25% | Dining out, entertainment, hobbies. |
| **Savings/Debt** | 20% | 15-20% | Emergency fund, committees (BCs), debt repayment. |

## 🛠️ How to Build Your Budget in 5 Steps
1.  **Track Every Rupee:** For one month, write down every expense. This reveals your true spending.
2.  **Categorize:** Sort expenses into Needs, Wants, and Savings. Be honest about what's essential.
3.  **Set SMART Goals:** e.g., "Save PKR 100,000 for an emergency fund in 10 months."
4.  **Create Your Plan:** Assign limits to each category. Pay yourself first by transferring savings immediately.
5.  **Review and Adjust:** At month's end, compare plan vs. reality and adjust.

## 💡 Essential Tips for the Pakistani Context
*   **Prioritize the Emergency Fund:** Aim for 3-6 months' expenses.
*   **Tackle High-Interest Debt First:** Pay off credit cards aggressively.
*   **Plan for Seasonal Spikes:** Save monthly for high summer electricity bills, Eid, and weddings.
*   **Involve the Family:** Discuss goals together to keep everyone on board.

Important: If Needs consume >80% of income, focus on increasing income through side hustles or upskilling.
