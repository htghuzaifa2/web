Below are dorm-tested dishes that marry desi soul with international swagger—no fancy gear, just your hostel saucepan and the spice box you already smuggle from home.

## 1. Tandoori Chicken Pizza – Lahore meets Naples
*   **Base:** ready-made pizza dough (Rs 120 from any supermarket).
*   **Sauce:** mix 3 tbsp ketchup + 1 tsp tandoori masala + garlic → desi marinara.
*   **Topping:** leftover tandoori chicken strips, capsicum, onion rings.
*   **Cheese:** regular cheddar (no shame) + sprinkle of chaat masala on top.
*   **Bake:** on tawa covered with lid, low flame 12 min → melty, spicy, done.

## 2. Butter Chicken Tacos – Karachi street in a tortilla
*   **Tortilla hack:** atta + water + pinch salt → roll thin, dry toast on tawa.
*   **Filling:** butter chicken (use hostel curry, shred pieces).
*   **Crunch:** shredded cabbage + imli chutney → same chatpata feels, new shape.
*   **Final pop:** squeeze of lemon + diced onions → taco Tuesday, Lahore style.

## 3. Biryani Burrito – wrap the love
*   **Wrap:** large atta roti (cook until just soft).
*   **Layer:** biryani rice, raita, salad, kebab piece → roll tight.
*   **Seal:** tawa toast for 1 min → crispy outside, steamy biryani inside.
*   **Meal-prep:** make 4, foil-wrap, microwave 30 sec → dinner for two nights.

## 4. Keema Mac & Cheese – desi hug in macaroni
*   **Boil** macaroni (salt + oil so it doesn’t stick).
*   **Sauce pan:** butter + flour (roux) → milk + cheddar (hostel fridge cheese works).
*   **Add:** fried keema (leftover from dinner) + black pepper + garam masala.
*   **Mix:** mac + sauce, top with bread crumbs, tawa-bake 10 min → comfort bowl ready.

## 5. Aloo Paratha Quesadilla – paratha gets a passport
*   **Stuff:** mashed aloo (add onion, chilli, chaat masala).
*   **Sandwich:** between two small rotis, press edges with fork (seals like emoji).
*   **Toast:** with butter on tawa, both sides 3 min → golden pockets.
*   **Dip:** yogurt + mint + salt → desi salsa.

## 6. Mango Lassi Popsicle – summer on a stick
*   **Blend:** yogurt + milk + mango chunks + sugar (or honey).
*   **Pour:** into disposable glasses, cover with foil, stick spoon as handle.
*   **Freeze:** hostel freezer (or ask the café guy) → 4 hrs later, pull out, run under tap, enjoy.

## 7. Spicy Lamb Slider – burger with nihari soul
*   **Patty:** keema + onion + green chilli + garam masala → shallow fry 3 min/side.
*   **Bun:** pav or small buns, toast with butter.
*   **Top:** mint chutney + onion rings → no lettuce needed, desi freshness wins.
*   **Serve:** with fries (frozen bag, air-fryer if available).

## 8. Chai-Infused Cheesecake (no-bake version)
*   **Base:** crushed biscuits + butter → press into steel bowl.
*   **Filling:** cream cheese (or whipped cream) + condensed milk + strong chai (2 tbsp).
*   **Set:** in freezer 3 hrs → demould, garnish with biscuit crumbs.
*   **Result:** chai flavour, creamy texture, hostel mates will pay for a slice.

## 9. Fusion Stir-Fry Romano Beans – beans meet bhunna
*   **Beans:** Romano or French beans, blanch 2 min.
*   **Stir-fry:** garlic + cumin + tomato (same base as aloo bhujia).
*   **Finish:** soy sauce splash + green chilli → Asian look, Pakistani soul.

## 10. Quinoa Biryani – grain swap, same drama
*   **Replace** rice with quinoa (rinsed well).
*   **Cook** biryani masala as usual, add quinoa + water (1:2 ratio), dum 15 min.
*   **Serve:** with raita, no one notices the grain change till they’re full.
