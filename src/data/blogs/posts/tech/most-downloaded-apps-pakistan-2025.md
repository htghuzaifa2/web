## 🔥 Honorable Mentions
*   **VPN apps** exploded after X (Twitter) ban—Super VPN hit 19.1 million downloads (+149 %).
*   **Tamasha** may rank 8th in downloads, but paid subscriptions jumped 367 %—proof Pakistanis will pay for local content.

## 🎯 Take-Away for You
*   If you’re not on TikTok/CapCut, you’re missing the viral train.
*   If you sell anything, WhatsApp Business > Instagram for local sales.
*   If you binge, Tamasha > Netflix in download numbers—support local creators.
