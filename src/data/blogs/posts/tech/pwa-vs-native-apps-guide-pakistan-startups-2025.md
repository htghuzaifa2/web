Below is the zero-rupee, hostel-friendly decision tree that turns “Should we build an app?” into “Here’s our launch plan” – all tested on 2G Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## 🇵🇰 Decision Tree – Which Should You Build?

| Scenario | Recommendation | Why It’s Perfect for PK Startups |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Budget < ₹ 1 Lakh** | PWA | 50–70 % cost savings – perfect for hostel budgets |
| **Need it yesterday** | PWA | Deploy in 6–10 weeks – no app store drama |
| **Need app-store marketing** | Native | App store visibility – perfect for Play Store marketing |
| **Need advanced camera / Bluetooth** | Native | Full device access – perfect for AR/VR features |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack – Hostel-Rankings

| Tech | Start-Up Cost | Hostel Hack | Why It’s Hot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PWA** | ₹ 50k–70k | React + Firebase → deploy in 6 weeks | Works on 2G once loaded |
| **Native** | ₹ 1 Lakh+ | Flutter + Firebase → deploy in 12 weeks | Full device access but costs more |

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** pick scenario → save in WhatsApp.
2.  **Tomorrow:** build first prototype → deploy on Replit.
3.  **Weekend:** deploy on Replit → share on WhatsApp.
4.  **Weekend:** become “tech guy of the dorm” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this decision tree → 2025 you will be “the guy who launched an app during load-shedding” while others still hunt for change.
