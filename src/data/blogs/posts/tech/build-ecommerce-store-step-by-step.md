*   **Payments:** Set up COD (essential) and digital gateways (JazzCash/PayFast).

## Phase 3: Build Your Store
*   **Shopify:** Best all-in-one for beginners.
*   **WooCommerce:** Great if you want customization on WordPress.
*   **Local:** Try Webx.pk for local integrations.

## Phase 4: Operations
*   **Logistics:** Partner with TCS, Leopards, or Call Courier.
*   **Packaging:** Branded, sturdy packaging builds trust.

## Phase 5: Launch & Market
*   **Mix:** Use Insta/TikTok for visuals, Performance Marketing (Meta Ads) for sales.
