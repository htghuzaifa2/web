## 🛡️ Smart Security & Financial Management Tips
Adopting the right habits is key to smart usage:

*   **Security First:** Never share your 5-digit PIN or MPIN with anyone. For your safety, both platforms and user communities advise against storing very large sums of money (e.g., over PKR 30,000) in a mobile wallet for extended periods. Treat it like a physical wallet.
*   **Avoid Costly Mistakes:** Double-check the recipient's mobile number or Raast ID before sending money, as transactions are instant and usually irreversible. Be mindful of transaction fees, especially for cash withdrawals and inter-bank transfers. For example, sending money via Raast to another bank has a fee based on the amount sent.
*   **Leverage Key Features:** Use JazzCash Tap Pay for quick, secure contactless payments at stores. With Easypaisa, share your Raast ID instead of your bank account number to receive payments. If you have children, JazzCash NextGen can help them learn financial management under your supervision.

## 💡 Pro-Tip: Use Both for Maximum Benefit
Many savvy users maintain accounts on both platforms to take advantage of their unique strengths. For instance, you might use:
*   **JazzCash** for receiving freelance income and contactless payments.
*   **Easypaisa** for daily bills and sending money via its intuitive Raast system.

This approach gives you maximum flexibility.
