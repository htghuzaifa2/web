Below is the zero-rupee, hostel-friendly snapshot of why your DDR4/5 is suddenly expensive – all tested on 2G Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## 🔑 What’s Happening (Hostel Translation)
*   **Global DRAM shortage** → AI servers are hogging memory → consumer DDR4/5 becomes scarce → prices triple.
*   **AI servers = “new iPhone”** → they buy memory in bulk → you fight for scraps.

## 📊 Price Snapshot (Hostel Reality)

| Memory | 2024 Price | Dec 2025 Price | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **32 GB DDR5** | ~$100 | ~$300+ | Triple price = triple pain ** |
| **256 GB DDR4** | ~$500 | ~$3,000+ | 500 % jump = 500 % pain ** |

*Headline number: 32 GB DDR5 = ₹ 25,000+ → triple price = triple pain **.*

## 🔍 Root Causes (Hostel Translation)
*   **AI Data Centers** → buy memory like iPhones → you fight for scraps **.
*   **Memory Reallocation** → factories make HBM for AI → consumer DDR4/5 becomes scarce **.
*   **Grid Dependency** → most devices need 24/7 power → load-shedding = dead cameras **.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** buy solar-powered unit → ₹ 3,000 → works during power-cuts **.
2.  **Tomorrow:** install on hostel rooftop → connect to Wi-Fi → works during power-cuts **.
3.  **Weekend:** test during power-cut → you can still submit assignments **.
4.  **Weekend:** become “the guy who has Wi-Fi during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this checklist → 2025 you will be “the guy who has Wi-Fi during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.
