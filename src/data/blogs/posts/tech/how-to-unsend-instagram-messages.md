Yes, you can unsend Instagram messages, but there are key limitations.

## 📱 How to Unsend
*   **Mobile App:** Long-press the message -> Tap "Unsend".
*   **Desktop:** Hover over message -> Click three dots -> Select "Unsend".

## ⚠️ Critical Limitations
1.  **Permanent Deletion:** It cannot be recovered by you or the recipient.
2.  **Notification:** The chat may show a placeholder saying you unsent a message.
3.  **Not Foolproof:** If they already saw it or took a screenshot, unsending does nothing.
4.  **No Time Limit:** You can unsend old messages.
5.  **Vanish Mode:** Does not apply (those disappear automatically).

*Note: You cannot recover a message you have already unsent.*
