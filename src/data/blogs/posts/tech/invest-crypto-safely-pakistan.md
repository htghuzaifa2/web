Investing in crypto from Pakistan requires navigating a complex regulatory environment.

## 📋 The Landscape
*   **Official Ban:** SBP prohibits banks from processing crypto transactions.
*   **Reality:** Adoption is high, but operates in a gray area.

## 🧭 How People Invest
| Method | How It Works | Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P2P Trading** | Direct buy/sell via escrow (Binance, OKX) using local bank transfers/JazzCash. | High scam risk (fake payments), potential bank account freezes. |
| **Non-Custodial** | Swap directly wallet-to-wallet (no KYC). | No support, high responsibility. |
| **Overseas Funds** | Using foreign bank accounts to invest in regulated markets abroad. | Requires legal foreign funds. |

## 🛡️ Safety Essentials
1.  **Use Hardware Wallets:** Self-custody is safer than keeping funds on an exchange.
2.  **Verify P2P Sellers:** Only trade with highly-rated, verified merchants.
3.  **Keep Records:** Document everything for potential tax or compliance needs.
4.  **Start Small:** Only invest what you can afford to lose.

**Warning:** You have no legal protection if scammed or if an exchange freezes your assets. Proceed with caution.
