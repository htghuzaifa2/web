| **EV 2-Wheelers** | 90 % of registrations | Payback 4–6 months | Cheapest entry → perfect for hostel scooters |
| **EV 4-Wheelers** | 20–64 % price premium | Payback 11–25 years | Too expensive → stick to 2-wheelers |
| **Charging Infrastructure** | Few functional chargers | Mostly urban | Range anxiety = real → stick to 2-wheelers |
| **Grid Readiness** | Load-shedding + fossil fuels | Charging unreliable | Stick to 2-wheelers → charge via AC outlet |
