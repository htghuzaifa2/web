*   **Channel:** Pakistani The Gamer
*   **Stats (2025):** 204k subs, 45 million views, $4.87–$14.61 per 1k views
*   **Monthly:** ~₹ 1.2 L (median RPM) → pays hostel rent + next GPU upgrade.

## 🎯 One-Week Launch Plan
1.  **Tonight:** pick game (PUBG, Valorant, Tekken) → record 15-min gameplay.
2.  **Tomorrow:** edit on CapCut → add humor + subtitles → upload to YouTube.
3.  **Weekend:** enable monetization (1k subs + 4k hours) → share in gaming FB groups.
4.  **Week 2:** go live on YouTube → enable Super Chat → first tips roll in.

## 🔚 Reality Check
*   **Cross-border limit:** USD 30k/year → file NTN, use Payoneer.
*   **Tax win:** 0–2.5 % if you file as freelancer → take-home stays fat.
