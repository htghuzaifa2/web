Below is a zero-rupee, 2G-friendly snapshot of how solar + smart tech is turning hostel rooms & roadside dhabas into mini tech hubs – all tested on 2G Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipend.

## 🌞 1. Solar-Powered Tech Hubs – “Hostel-Room Friendly”
*   **What:** Solar panels + battery + Wi-Fi router + smart devices → mini tech hub.
*   **Where:** Hostel rooftops, roadside dhabas, rural schools.
*   **Why:** No grid = no power-cut = no “hostel Wi-Fi dies at 2 a.m.”
*   **Cost:** ₹ 5,000–10,000 (solar panel + battery + router) → pays for itself in 18 months.
*   **Example:** Solar-powered Wi-Fi router → works during power-cut → you can still submit assignments.

## 🔌 2. Solar-Powered Wi-Fi Routers – “No Grid, No Problem”
*   **What:** Solar panel + battery + 4G dongle → personal hotspot.
*   **Where:** Hostel rooftops, rural schools, roadside dhabas.
*   **Why:** No grid = no power-cut = no “hostel Wi-Fi dies at 2 a.m.”
*   **Cost:** ₹ 3,000–5,000 (solar panel + battery + 4G dongle) → pays for itself in 12 months.
*   **Example:** Solar-powered Wi-Fi router → works during power-cut → you can still submit assignments.

## 🔌 3. Solar-Powered Wi-Fi Routers – “No Grid, No Problem”
*   **What:** Solar panel + battery + 4G dongle → personal hotspot.
*   **Where:** Hostel rooftops, rural schools, roadside dhabas.
*   **Why:** No grid = no power-cut = no “hostel Wi-Fi dies at 2 a.m.”
*   **Cost:** ₹ 3,000–5,000 (solar panel + battery + 4G dongle) → pays for itself in 12 months.
*   **Example:** Solar-powered Wi-Fi router → works during power-cut → you can still submit assignments.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** buy solar panel + battery + Wi-Fi router → ₹ 5,000 total.
2.  **Tomorrow:** install on hostel rooftop → connect to 4G dongle.
3.  **Weekend:** test during power-cut → you can still submit assignments.
4.  **Weekend:** become “the guy who has Wi-Fi during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.
