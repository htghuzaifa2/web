I’ve tested these on a Rs 28k Samsung with hostel Wi-Fi that dies at 2 a.m. – only the ones that actually load and don’t eat your data made the cut.

## 🧠 1. Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (Free for Uni Students)
*   **What you get:** Deep research, essay drafts, data crunch, plus 2 TB cloud storage so your project files don’t vanish when the USB dies.
*   **Pak perk:** Works in roman Urdu, plugs straight into Docs & Slides – no copy-paste circus.
*   **Price:** Zero for a year if you have a student email – sign-up link floats around campus WhatsApp groups every semester.

## ✍️ 2. QuillBot (Freemium)
*   **Use:** Paraphrase, summarise, auto-cite in APA/MLA – saves you from the “similarity > 25 %” LMS panic.
*   **Hostel hack:** Paste your messy paragraph, hit “Simple” mode – instant clean English for presentations.

## 📄 3. ChatPDF (Browser)
*   **Use:** Upload a 200-page PDF, ask “summarise in 5 bullets” – beats scrolling at 3 a.m. before the viva.
*   **Data friendly:** Compressed PDF first at tool.huzi.pk so it uploads even on 2G.

## 🎨 4. Gamma AI (Free tier)
*   **Use:** Type “hostel food survey results” → gets you a polished slide deck in 30 seconds – no Canva drag-drop drama.
*   **Bonus:** Export as PPT, tweak colours, done. Profs think you spent hours.

## 🔍 5. Perplexity AI (Free)
*   **Use:** Ask “latest 2025 tax slabs Pakistan site:gov.pk” → gets cited answers, no Wikipedia rabbit hole.
*   **Pro tip:** Switch to “Academic” filter for journal-grade sources your HEC prof loves.

## 📱 6. Otter.ai (Free 300 min/mo)
*   **Use:** Record the 8 a.m. lecture, auto-transcribe – read at night when brain actually works.
*   **Pak setting:** Choose “English (Pakistan)” so “schedule” doesn’t become “shedule”.

## Quick starter combo (zero-rupee routine)
1.  Record lecture → **Otter**
2.  PDF notes → **ChatPDF** summary
3.  Draft essay → **Gemini** in Google Docs
4.  Paraphrase → **QuillBot**
5.  Slides → **Gamma**
6.  Compress files → **tool.huzi.pk** before LMS upload

Lock this routine for a week – your grades (and data bundle) will thank you.
