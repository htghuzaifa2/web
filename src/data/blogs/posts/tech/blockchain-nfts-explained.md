Blockchain is the underlying technology—a secure, shared digital ledger—while NFTs are one specific type of digital asset built on top of that technology to prove unique ownership.

The table below summarizes their key differences and connection.

| Feature | Blockchain (The Foundation) | NFTs (The Application) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | A shared, immutable digital ledger that records transactions. | Unique digital tokens that prove ownership of a specific asset. |
| **Key Trait** | **Immutability & Decentralization:** Records can't be altered and are maintained by a network, not a single authority. | **Non-fungibility & Scarcity:** Each token is one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged like-for-like. |
| **Main Function** | Provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system for recording data (like transactions or agreements). | Acts as a verifiable digital certificate of ownership and authenticity for a unique item, digital or physical. |

## 🔗 How They Work Together
Think of blockchain as a public, unchangeable record book. When an NFT is created or "minted," a permanent entry is made in this record book. This entry contains essential information:
1.  A unique identifier (like a serial number) for the NFT.
2.  A record of ownership, which updates whenever the NFT is sold or transferred.
3.  A link to the digital asset it represents (like a JPG or video file).

This process uses smart contracts—self-executing agreements written in code that live on the blockchain. They automatically handle the rules, like transferring ownership when payment is received.

## 💡 Common Uses for NFTs
While digital art popularized NFTs, their use has expanded:
*   **Digital Collectibles:** Art, music, video clips (like NBA highlights), and memes.
*   **Gaming:** Ownership of in-game items, characters, or virtual land.
*   **Memberships & Tickets:** Event tickets or club memberships that can't be forged.
*   **Real-World Assets:** Tokenizing physical items like real estate or luxury goods to simplify proof of ownership.

## ⚠️ Practical Considerations and Risks
If you're interested in buying or creating NFTs, here's what you should know:

*   **You Need a Crypto Wallet:** To interact with NFT marketplaces, you'll need a digital wallet to store cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum) and your NFT assets.
*   **Marketplaces are the Gateway:** Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and NBA Top Shot are where most NFTs are bought, sold, and created.
*   **Understand the Major Risks:**
    *   **High Volatility:** NFT values can fluctuate wildly based on speculation and demand.
    *   **Scams & Fraud:** The space has risks like counterfeit NFTs, "rug pulls" (where developers abandon a project), and phishing attempts.
    *   **Environmental Impact:** Some blockchains (like earlier versions of Ethereum) use energy-intensive processes, though many are transitioning to more efficient systems.
