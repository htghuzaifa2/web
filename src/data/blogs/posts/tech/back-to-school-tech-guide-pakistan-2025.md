Below is the zero-rupee, 2G-friendly checklist that turns “I forgot my charger” into “I’m the tech guy of the dorm”—all tested on a Rs 28k stipend and hostel Wi-Fi that dies at 2 a.m.

## 🏠 Dorm-Room Tech Essentials (Under ₹ 2,000)

| Item | Why You Need It | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Bank 20,000 mAh** | Hostel UPS dies at 2 a.m. → you still submit assignments | Buy from Daraz flash sale → ₹ 1,200 |
| **Wi-Fi Extender** | Boosts hostel signal → you get 3 bars instead of 1 | Plug near common room → everyone loves you |
| **Laptop Sleeve + Backpack** | Prevents “mess food vs laptop” disasters | Pick one with USB port → charge on the move |
| **Wireless Earbuds** | Block uncle-snoring during 8 a.m. Zoom | ₹ 800 JBL knock-off → still better than wire tangles |

## 💻 Laptop Must-Haves (Under ₹ 40k)
*   **Dell Latitude E7270** → i5 + 8 GB RAM + SSD → boots in 12 seconds → perfect for “between-class binge”.
*   **Lenovo ThinkPad X260** → ThinkPad keyboard = assignment heaven → ₹ 38k but feels ₹ 80k.
*   **Dell Latitude 3190** → ₹ 25k but still runs Chrome + Word → cheapest usable machine.

## 🔌 Power & Connectivity Hacks
*   **Jazz/Zong 4G Pocket Wi-Fi** → ₹ 3,500 → personal hotspot when hostel Wi-Fi dies.
*   **Portable Charger 60W** → ₹ 1,500 → charges laptop + phone during power-cut.
*   **Smart Lanyard USB-C Cable** → ₹ 899 → wear it like ID, charge on the move.

## 🧠 Study & Productivity Hacks
*   **Google Calendar Time-Blocking** → block 2-hour study slots → hostel common-room loves the discipline.
*   **Canva Student Account** → free → design presentations, edit photos, make memes.
*   **Google Keep Voice Notes** → record lecture summaries → listen during mess queue.

## 🛒 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** bookmark Daraz flash sale → add power-bank + earbuds to cart.
2.  **Weekend:** wait for flash sale → prices drop 10-15 %.
3.  **Next week:** unbox, set up, post unboxing on TikTok → become “tech guy of the dorm”.

Lock this list → 2025 you will be the “guy who always has a charger” while others still hunt for change.
