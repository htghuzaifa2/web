I’ve banged my head on the keyboard trying to pick one AI to finish my code before the hostel Wi-Fi dies – below is the no-fluff comparison that finally saved my semester.

## 🥇 Gemini 3 Pro – the new campus king
*   **Coding crown:** 76.2 % SWE-bench Verified (beats Claude Sonnet 4.5’s 70 %).
*   **Context monster:** 1M tokens in, 64K out – paste your entire project, it won’t blink.
*   **Video super-power:** only model that eats full video for analysis – handy if your project involves motion clips.
*   **Price like canteen chai:** $2-4 per million tokens (free tier exists).
*   **Voice input:** 24 languages, including roman Urdu – shout your prompt, it understands.
*   **Verdict:** if you want raw performance + multimodal without selling a kidney, Gemini 3 Pro is the default choice right now.

## 🥈 Claude Sonnet 4.5 – the consistent class topper
*   **Code quality:** 70 % SWE-bench, best-in-class autonomous agent mode – writes longer scripts with fewer hiccups.
*   **Thinking cap:** hybrid reasoning → explains why it wrote that line, not just the line.
*   **Wallet-friendly:** $3/$15 per million, free tier available.
*   **Context:** 200K tokens – enough for a fat Django project.
*   **Verdict:** pick Claude when you need clean, explainable code and don’t want to babysit the AI.

## 🥉 On4t – the quiet kid in the corner
*   **Reality check:** On4t isn’t listed in the top 15 models/tools of Dec 2025 rankings.
*   **Likely position:** smaller dev-tool or wrapper around bigger models – usable but no benchmark crown.
*   **Use if:** you already pay for it or need a very specific niche (video editing, SEO, etc.) – verify via free trial first.

## 🧠 Quick pick cheat-sheet

| Your need | Winner |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Best code + video** | Gemini 3 Pro |
| **Cleanest explanations** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 |
| **Already using On4t** | Test vs Gemini free tier → switch if savings > 30 % |

**Pro tip:** all three offer free tiers – run your actual code through each for a week; time saved > subscription cost = keeper.

And if you ever need to compress that giant video before uploading to Gemini, I’ve parked a tiny compressor on tool.huzi.pk that opens even when the generator coughs.
