You can use DeepSeek's AI assistant to search for information in Urdu. While there isn't a dedicated "search engine" mode, you can ask it questions and request information directly in the chat, as the app fully supports the Urdu language. Think of it as having a knowledgeable assistant you can converse with in Urdu.

## 💬 How to "Search" and Ask Better Questions
Once you're in the chat, you can ask DeepSeek anything. For better answers, structure your questions as you would when asking a helpful expert.

*   **Ask Directly:** You can ask for explanations, summaries, or lists.
    *   *Example:* "پاکستان کے آئین کی دفعات کے بارے میں مجھے بتائیں۔" (Tell me about the articles of Pakistan's constitution.)
*   **Ask for Comparisons:** Request comparisons between concepts or items.
    *   *Example:* "سولر انرجی اور ونڈ انرجی کے درمیان فرق بتائیں۔" (Explain the difference between solar and wind energy.)
*   **Request Creative Help:** Ask for ideas, stories, or content drafting.
    *   *Example:* "رمضان کے لیے ایک مختصر تقریر لکھنے میں میری مدد کریں۔" (Help me write a short speech for Ramadan.)
*   **Get Explanations:** Have it break down complex topics in simple terms.
    *   *Example:* "بلاک چین ٹیکنالوجی کو آسان اردو میں سمجھائیں۔" (Explain blockchain technology in simple Urdu.)

## ⚠️ Important Points to Remember
DeepSeek is a powerful tool, but it's helpful to know how it works for the best experience.

*   **It's Not a Web Crawler:** DeepSeek provides answers based on its trained knowledge, not live internet search results. For the very latest news or live sports scores, you may need to check a traditional search engine.
*   **Clarity is Key:** The more specific and clear your Urdu question is, the more accurate and helpful the answer will be. Avoid vague or overly brief prompts.
*   **Fact-Check Critical Information:** For very important facts—like medical, legal, or financial advice—it's always a good practice to verify the information with official sources.
*   **It Can Assist in Other Tasks:** Beyond answering questions, you can use DeepSeek's chat to get help with math problems, coding, writing, and logical reasoning in Urdu as well.

To make the most of it, try asking a clear, specific question on a topic you're interested in. For example, you could start with: "ذاتی مالیات کا انتظام کیسے کریں، اس کے بارے میں ایک بنیادی گائیڈ بتائیں۔" (Give me a basic guide on how to manage personal finance.)
