1.  **Tonight:** buy solar camera → ₹ 3,000 → works during power-cuts.
2.  **Tomorrow:** install on hostel rooftop → connect to Wi-Fi → works during power-cuts.
3.  **Weekend:** test during power-cut → you can still see who’s at the gate.
4.  **Weekend:** become “the guy who has security during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this checklist → 2025 you will be “the guy who has security during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.
