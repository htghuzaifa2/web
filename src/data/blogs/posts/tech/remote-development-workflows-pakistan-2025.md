## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** pick one tool → save in WhatsApp.
2.  **Tomorrow:** build first prototype → upload to GitHub.
3.  **Weekend:** deploy on Replit → share on WhatsApp.
4.  **Weekend:** become “tech guy of the dorm” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this decision tree → 2025 you will be “the guy who launched an app during load-shedding” while others still hunt for change.
