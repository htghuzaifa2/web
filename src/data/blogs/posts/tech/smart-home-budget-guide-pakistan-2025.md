Below is the zero-fluff, 2G-friendly roadmap that turns your 6-by-6 hostel room into a smart den—all under ₹ 10,000 and no electrician drama.

## 🧱 Step 1: Start Small (₹ 1,500 – ₹ 2,500)

| Device | What It Does | Hostel Hack | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Wi-Fi Bulb** | Remote ON/OFF + dimming + colors | Control via Tuya app → no wiring needed | ₹ 1,500 – 2,500 |
| **Smart Wi-Fi Plug** | Turns any appliance smart (fan, iron, kettle) | Plug into socket → control via app | ₹ 2,000 – 3,500 |

*Result: lights off at 2 a.m. without leaving your bunk → hostel mates think you’re a wizard.*

## 🎛️ Step 2: Level-Up (₹ 3,000 – ₹ 6,000)

| Device | What It Does | Hostel Hack | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Touch Switch** | Replaces wall switch → app/voice control | Install over existing switch → no rewiring | ₹ 3,000 – 6,000 |
| **Smart IR Remote** | Controls AC, TV, fan (one remote to rule them all) | Place on desk → control via app | ₹ 2,500 – 4,000 |

*Result: AC off at 2 a.m. without hunting for the remote → hostel mates think you’re a wizard.*

## 📹 Step 3: Security (₹ 4,000 – ₹ 7,500)

| Device | What It Does | Hostel Hack | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Wi-Fi Camera** | HD live stream + motion alerts | Place on desk → view on phone | ₹ 4,000 – 7,500 |

*Result: watch your bunk from the mess → hostel mates think you’re a wizard.*

## 🛒 Where to Buy (Hostel-Friendly)
*   **Daraz.pk** – flash sales, student discounts, delivers to hostel gate.
*   **Walton Market** – trusted local store, nationwide shipping.
*   **Mi Store** – official Tuya devices, student discounts.

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** order Smart Bulb + Smart Plug → total under ₹ 5,000.
2.  **Weekend:** plug in, download Tuya app, name devices (“Bunk Light”, “Fan”).
3.  **Next week:** add Smart Switch → control everything from bed.
4.  **Month 2:** add Smart Camera → watch your bunk from the mess.

Lock this list → 2025 you will be the “guy who controls his room from bed” while others still hunt for the light switch.
