## 🔐 1. Hostel-Room Starter Pack (₹ 0)
*   **Kali Linux** → install on USB → practice ethical hacking.
*   **OWASP ZAP** → scan your web app → find vulnerabilities.

*   *Tip: Practice on your own apps first → then scan your hostel project.*

## 🔐 2. Zero-Trust for Hostel Rooms
*   **Strong passwords** → 12 characters + symbols → store in KeePass.
*   **2-Factor Auth (2FA)** → enable on GitHub, bank, cloud → no OTP drama.
*   **Updates auto-on** → Windows, apps, antivirus → no “update later” drama.
*   *Tip: 2FA via WhatsApp → works on 2G once loaded.*
