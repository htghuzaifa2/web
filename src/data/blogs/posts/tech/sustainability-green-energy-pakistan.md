Pakistan is facing a dual challenge: energy crisis and climate change. Here is how the country is responding.

## ⚡ Green Energy Revolution
*   **Target:** 30% renewable energy by 2030.
*   **Solar Boom:** Massive adoption of rooftop solar is happening, driven by high electricity costs.
*   **Challenge:** The grid is struggling to handle this decentralized power, and net-metering policies are under debate.

## 🏙️ Climate Resilience
*   **Urban Cooling:** Projects to plant urban forests and green roofs to combat heatwaves.
*   **Water:** "Recharge Pakistan" aims to manage floods and restore wetlands.
*   **Clean Transport:** A slow but necessary push for electric buses and huge potential for EV 2/3-wheelers.

## ⚖️ The Debate
While the private "solar revolution" allows energy independence for those who can afford it, it risks leaving the grid expensive for lower-income households. A fair transition is the next big policy challenge.
