Below is a zero-rupee, hostel-friendly snapshot of GPU market trends for 2026 – all tested on 2G Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipit.

## 🔑 Root Cause: “AI Servers = New iPhones”
*   **AI data centers are buying memory like iPhones** → you fight for scraps.
*   **HBM (High-Bandwidth Memory) = new gold** → factories switch from DDR to HBM → consumer DDR becomes scarce.
*   **Result:** DDR5 prices tripled in 2 months → Tom’s Guide calls it “RAMageddon” **.

*Headline number: 32 GB DDR5 = ₹ 25,000+ → triple price = triple pain **.*

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** wait for Jan-Feb 2026 → possible 10–15 % drop.
2.  **Tomorrow:** set price alerts on Daraz → get SMS when price drops.
3.  **Weekend:** buy during post-holiday dip → possible 10–15 % drop.
4.  **Weekend:** become “the guy who bought during the dip” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this checklist → 2025 you will be “the guy who bought during the dip” while others still hunt for change.
