Below is the student-friendly, zero-jargon snapshot of where the jobs are going—and where the money is growing—as AI punches into Pakistan’s economy.

## 📉 Jobs AI Will Steal (Prepare, Don’t Panic)

| Sector | At-Risk Roles | Hostel-Room Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Call Centres** | Entry-level customer support | Learn chatbot design (free Google AI course) |
| **Textile Mills** | Manual stitching, inventory clerks | Upskill to “AI maintenance tech” (6-month diploma) |
| **Retail / E-commerce** | Cashiers, data-entry | Pivot to “e-com store manager” (Shopify + ads) |
| **Transport** | Truck / bus drivers (long-term) | Train as “logistics tech operator” (GPS + fleet software) |

*Headline number: 17 % of all Pakistani jobs are at high risk of automation by 2030.*

## 📈 Jobs AI Will Create (Grab Fast)

| New Role | Monthly PKR | How to Start Today |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Chatbot Builder** | ₹ 1.5–3 L | Python + OpenAI API → build 1 bot → upload GitHub |
| **Cloud / DevOps Remote** | ₹ 1.8–3 L | AWS Cloud Practitioner cert (free) → apply on LinkedIn Remote |
| **Data Analyst (Remote)** | ₹ 1–2 L | Excel + SQL + Tableau Public → analyse hostel food expenses → portfolio |
| **Cyber-Security Remote** | ₹ 1–2.3 L | TryHackMe beginner paths → ethical hacking cert → bug-bounty start |
| **AI Content / Prompt Writer** | ₹ 80k–1.5 L | ChatGPT + Canva → build 3 viral posts → Fiverr gig |

*Government target: 1 million AI professionals to be trained by 2030 (3,000 scholarships/year).*

## 🎯 2026 Hostel-Roadmap (Start This Week)
1.  **Tonight:** pick one skill above → bookmark free course (Google AI Essentials / AWS Cloud Practitioner).
2.  **This week:** build 1 mini-project → push to GitHub → add to LinkedIn.
3.  **Next week:** create Fiverr gig → price at $5/hr → collect first review.
4.  **Month 1:** raise price 20 % → apply to 5 LinkedIn remote jobs → land first client.

## ⚠️ Reality Check
*   **Cross-border limit:** USD 30k/year → stay legal, file NTN, use Payoneer/Wise.
*   **Tax win:** 0–2.5 % tax if you file as freelancer → take-home stays fat.

Lock one skill today → 2026 you will be the “guy who pays rent on time” while AI does the boring stuff.
