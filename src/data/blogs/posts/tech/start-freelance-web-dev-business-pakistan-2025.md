Turn your 6-by-6 hostel room into a money-making dev studio—no dad-money, no fancy office, just your laptop and the will to survive the next power-cut.

## 🎯 Step 1: Pick Your Niche (1 Hour)
*   **Ask yourself:**
    *   Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack?
    *   WordPress sites, e-commerce, or React apps?
    *   Who will pay you? (local salons, student societies, small exporters)
*   *Pro tip: start narrow → “I build WordPress sites for tuition centres” → less competition, faster money.*

## 🧰 Step 2: Build Your Toolkit (Free)

| Tool | Use | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VS Code** | Code editor | Install offline < 200 MB |
| **GitHub** | Portfolio + version control | Push every project → public proof |
| **Figma** | Mock-ups | Free student account → design on phone |
| **LocalWP** | WordPress offline | Build sites without internet |

*Skill plug: HTML, CSS, JS + WordPress = 90 % of local demand.*

## 💼 Step 3: Register Like a Pro (Zero Rupees)
*   **Bank account:** student savings → **ask for “freelancer letter” → opens Payoneer later.
*   **NTN:** free at FBR iris → becomes “tax filer” → clients trust you.
*   **Name:** “YourName Web” → simple, memorable, Instagram-searchable.

## 🖼️ Step 4: Portfolio in One Weekend
**Build this:**
1.  **One-page site** (yourname.com.pk) → Rs 1,200/year hosting (HosterPK).
2.  **Three demo projects:**
    *   Tuition-centre landing page
    *   Personal blog (your CV)
    *   Fake restaurant (menu + contact form)
*   *Add screenshots → write 2-line case study (“Built in 3 days, got 3 leads”) → upload to GitHub.*
*   *No code yet? → build in Canva → export as site → still counts.*

## 💰 Step 5: Price Like a Student (Not a Shark)

| Service | Student Rate | Delivery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5-page WordPress site** | Rs 8,000 | 3 days |
| **Landing page** | Rs 4,000 | 24 hrs |
| **Blog setup** | Rs 2,500 | same day |

*Rule: cheap + fast → builds portfolio, gets reviews, raises rates later.*

## 📣 Step 6: Get Clients (No Cold-Calling)
*   **WhatsApp status:** “Need a website? DM me” → friends first.
*   **University societies:** offer free maintenance → they refer you.
*   **Fiverr:** gig title “I will build WordPress site for tuition centres” → Rs 500 start.
*   **Local shops:** show demo on phone → “pay after delivery” → trust builder.

## 🤝 Step 7: Deliver & Get Paid
*   **Use Upwork/Fiverr escrow** → money held, release after delivery.
*   **Direct clients:** 50 % upfront, 50 % on launch → bank transfer or JazzCash.
*   **Invoice:** free template (Canva) → PDF + WhatsApp.

## 📈 Step 8: Scale (6-Month Plan)
1.  Raise rates 20 % every 3 projects → Rs 8k → 10k → 12k.
2.  Add services: SEO setup, speed optimization, monthly maintenance.
3.  Hire friend: you design, they code → split profit, double output.

### 🎯 One-Week Kick-Start Checklist
1.  Tonight: buy domain, build 1-page site (Canva).
2.  Tomorrow: create Fiverr gig, upload 3 demos.
3.  Weekend: build tuition-centre demo, post on WhatsApp.
4.  Next week: deliver first client, collect review, raise price.

Lock this routine → 2025 you will be the “web guy” in every group chat before the next power-cut.
