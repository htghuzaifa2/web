## 📱 Bonus Hack – WiFi Map App

*   **How to use:**
    1.  Download WiFi Map (free).
    2.  Open app → it shows nearby hotspots + passwords.

*   **Coverage:** 555 hotspots in Lahore alone (restaurants, clinics, colleges).

## ⚠️ Reality Check
*   **Speed cap:** suitable for WhatsApp, LMS, light browsing—not Netflix.
*   **Ethics:** don’t hog bandwidth—others need to submit assignments too.
*   **Safety:** avoid personal banking on open networks—use mobile data for that.

**Bottom Line:** Bookmark this page → next time the hostel Wi-Fi dies, walk to the nearest park, connect to “Punjab Free Wi-Fi”, and submit your assignment before the next power-cut.
