## 🧑‍💻 Freelance / Remote Bonus
*   **AI chatbot builder** → $1,200–$3,000/month → Payoneer = ₹ 3–7 L/month.
*   **Cloud + DevOps gigs** → $95k–$130k/year → remote = ₹ 2–3 L/month.
*   **Product Manager remote** → $130k/year → remote = ₹ 3.2 L/month.

## 🎯 Hostel-Roadmap (Zero Rupee Start)
1.  **Pick one skill** → Python (AI) or React (full-stack).
2.  **Certify free** → Google AI Essentials, AWS Cloud Practitioner (online).
3.  **Build 3 projects** → GitHub portfolio + demo site (Canva).
4.  **Apply** → Fiverr, LinkedIn, local start-ups → start at ₹ 65k, raise 20 % every 3 gigs.

## 🔚 Reality Check
*   **Tax:** slab 0–2.5 % if you file as freelancer → take-home stays fat.
*   **Cross-border limit:** USD 30k/year → remote gigs stay legal.

Lock one skill → 2026 you will be the “guy who pays rent on time” while others still hunt for change.
