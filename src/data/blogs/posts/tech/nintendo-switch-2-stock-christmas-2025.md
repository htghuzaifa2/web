## ✅ Still-In-Stock Scoreboard (Dec 23)

| Retailer | Console Stand-Alone | Mario-Kart Bundle | Pokémon Z-A Bundle | Notes / Shipping Cut-Off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Amazon US | ✅ In Stock | ✅ Arrives 24 Dec | ❌ Sold Out | Choose "Tomorrow" at checkout; Prime required in most ZIPs |
| Best Buy | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ❌ Sold Out | Same-day delivery or 2-hr store pick-up still live in 47 states |
| Walmart | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ❌ Sold Out | Free overnight for Walmart+ members; store pick-up slots until 6 p.m. 24 Dec |
| GameStop / EB | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | Door-buster stock dropped this morning; no shipping, but in-store hold until close 24 Dec |
| Target | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ❌ Sold Out | Drive-Up orders accepted until 7 p.m. local 24 Dec (check app) |
| Costco | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ❌ Sold Out | Members only; 2-day express still promising 24 Dec delivery in metro areas |
| Nintendo.com | ✅ In Stock | ✅ In Stock | ❌ Sold Out | FedEx Overnight cut-off 2 p.m. ET today; after that switch to pick-up at Nintendo NY store (Rockefeller Center) until 8 p.m. 24 Dec |

**Google Pixel Watch 4 – quick bonus:** Amazon, Best Buy, Target all show 42 mm Wi-Fi in stock with same-day courier in most cities; LTE models already gone until 26 Dec.

## 🚚 Shipping Reality Check (Dec 23-24)

- **Standard ground** = post-Christmas everywhere.
- **Express / overnight windows** close today (23 Dec) at 2-3 p.m. ET for major carriers.
- **Store pick-up** is your highest-yield play—slots refresh every hour as stores allocate overnight freight.

## 🎯 Action Plan – 3-Minute Drill

1. Add to cart at Amazon OR Best Buy (fastest courier nets).
2. Toggle shipping to "Tomorrow/Same-Day"; if unavailable, switch to store pick-up and reserve slot immediately.
3. Screenshot confirmation; bring ID + order # tomorrow—no lines if you use curbside.

**Missed the courier cut-off?** Head to GameStop or Target first thing 24 Dec—they're holding unclaimed units for walk-ins until 6-7 p.m.

## 🔚 Bottom Line

**Nintendo Switch 2** is still findable less than 36 hours from Santa's touchdown, but only if you combine express shipping OR same-day store pick-up. Pixel Watch 4 Wi-Fi is the easy add-on; LTE requires a post-Christmas rain-check. Stop reading—go reserve now, because by 3 p.m. today the overnight window slams shut and your only option becomes standing in line tomorrow morning.
