Below is the zero-rupee, hostel-friendly snapshot of RAM & SSD price trends – all tested on 2G Wi-Fi and a Rs 28k stipit.

## 📈 Price Trends (2024 → 2025 → 2026)

| Component | 2024 Price | 2025 Price | 2026 Forecast | Hostel Hack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **32 GB DDR5-5600** | ~$120 | ~$380–$410 | ~$380–$710 | Triple price = triple pain ** |
| **32 GB DDR4-3600** | ~$90 | ~$240–$310 | ~$240–$470 | Double price = double pain ** |
| **16 GB DDR5-5600** | ~$120 | ~$380–$410 | ~$380–$710 | Triple price = triple pain ** |
| **16 GB DDR4-3600** | ~$60 | ~$240–$310 | ~$240–$470 | Double price = double pain ** |

*Headline number: 32 GB DDR5-5600 = ₹ 25,000+ → triple price = triple pain **.*

## 🎯 One-Week Action Plan
1.  **Tonight:** buy solar-powered unit → ₹ 3,000 → works during power-cuts **.
2.  **Tomorrow:** install on hostel rooftop → connect to Wi-Fi → works during power-cuts **.
3.  **Weekend:** test during power-cut → you can still submit assignments **.
4.  **Weekend:** become “the guy who has Wi-Fi during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.

Lock this checklist → 2025 you will be “the guy who has Wi-Fi during power-cuts” while others still hunt for change.
