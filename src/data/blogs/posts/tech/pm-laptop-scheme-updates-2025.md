*   ✅ **Phase-IV is LIVE** – 100,000 laptops being distributed across Pakistan right now.
*   ✅ **Application window closed on 1 June 2025** – no new registrations are being accepted.
*   ✅ **Distribution is merit-based** – check your selection status today via the portal below.

## 🔍 Check Your Status Now
1.  **Visit:** laptop.pmyp.gov.pk
2.  **Enter:** CNIC + select university → instant result shows “Selected / Not-Selected”.
3.  **If selected:** wait for SMS/email from your university focal person with collection date & venue.

## ✅ Who Got the Laptops?
*   Public-sector university students enrolled as of 30 March 2025
*   CGPA ≥ 2.8 (cumulative) – no conversion drama, university standard applies
*   Affiliated colleges are **NOT** eligible – only main campuses

## 📦 What You’ll Receive
*   Windows 11 laptop + Microsoft Office 365 (pre-activated)
*   Activation email sent to your registered address after physical hand-over

## 📅 What’s Happening Now?
*   Laptops rolling out university-wise – IIUI already distributed 3,521 units
*   If you missed collection date → contact uni focal person within 10 working days or forfeit the award

## 🚨 Quick Reality Check
*   **Once awarded = no second laptop** – even if you jump to Masters
*   **Wrong CNIC / father’s CNIC = auto-reject** – use your own only

**Bottom line:** if your status shows “Selected”, keep your phone on – the SMS is coming. If it says “Not Selected”, wait for next phase – history says it returns every 2-3 years.
