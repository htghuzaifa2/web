**Final score:** Houston Texans 23 – Las Vegas Raiders 21  
**NRG Stadium, Houston | 21 Dec 2025 | Att. 71,835**

## 🔭 Zoom-Out Snapshot

- **Raiders** arrived 0-2 in their last two, shut-out by Philly the week prior, and hadn't cracked 20 points since Week 9.
- **Texans** brought the league's stingiest defense (17.4 ppg) and a five-game win streak.
- **Spread:** HOU ‑6.5 | O/U: 40 → Vegas covered, total pushed over on the final knee.

## 🏎️ First Quarter: Pick-Six & the 19-Yard Hangover

**14:07** — On 2nd-and-7, Geno Smith throws off his back foot targeting Ashton Jeanty in the flat; Derek Stingley Jr. jumps it, houses the pick 31 yds. Texans 7-0.

Raiders' next three drives: 6 plays, 6 plays, 3 plays — but Houston's offense can't capitalize (19 total yards) thanks to Maxx Crosby's 3-yard TFL and a thunderous Jamal Adams stop on 3rd-and-1.

**Score after 1:** HOU 7-0

**Hidden stat:** Raiders D held Texans to 0-for-4 on 3rd down in the opening quarter.

## ⚔️ Second Quarter: Smith vs. Fairbairn Field-Goal Clinic

**12:30** — Geno rebounds with 7 straight completions, capping a 75-yard march with a 7-yard strike to Brock Bowers (zone sit-down vs. Cover-3). 7-7.

Texans answer with two long Ka'imi Fairbairn boots: 55 yds and 50 yds (career-long indoors).

Both drives stalled inside the 40; Crosby & Malcolm Koonce generated quick pressure on C.J. Stroud.

**Halftime:** HOU 13-7

Raiders' locker-room vibe: "We're moving it—just don't turn it over."

## 🔥 Third Quarter: The Ashton Jeanty Show Begins

**9:47** — 3rd-and-4, Raiders break a wheel route to Jeanty out of the backfield. He sheds a LB, out-runs safety Jalen Pitre, and is gone 60 yards down the sideline. Raiders take their first lead since Week 11 (14-13).

Texans counter with a 12-play, 75-yard grind; Stroud buys time, finds Dalton Schultz on a goal-line stick (2-yd TD). Two-point conversion fails — HOU 19-14.

**End-3:** HOU 19-14

**Jeanty through 45 min:** 14 touches, 154 scrimmage yards.

## 🎢 Fourth Quarter: 51 Yards of Hope, 5:24 of Heartbreak

**5:50** — Inside zone left, Jeanty bounces, breaks an ankle-tackle, hits the jets 51 yards to the house. Raiders 21-19 (2-pt try dropped).

**Career highs:** 24 carries, 188 scrimmage yards, 2 TDs.

**5:24 left** — Texans ball, up 2. They convert three 3rd-and-longs:

- **3rd-and-20:** PI on Darien Porter (33 yd flag).
- **3rd-and-8:** Nico Collins mosses the CB on a 37-yard sideline laser.
- **3rd-and-4:** Stroud QB sneak for 5.

Two kneel-downs, game over.

**Final:** Texans 23-21 (Fairbairn tacks on 32-yd FG with :08 left).

## 📊 Key Numbers That Flip the Narrative

| Category | LV | HOU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total yards | 336 | 292 |
| 3rd-down | 6-14 (43%) | 5-13 (38%) |

| Explosive (20+) | 5 | 3 |

**Explosive plays:** Raiders finally won that battle; the one giveaway still loomed largest.

## 🎤 Sound-Bite Theatre

**Geno Smith:** "Moral victories suck, but the locker-room energy was different—guys kept swinging."

**Ashton Jeanty:** "We fought. Didn't get the W, but we showed who we can be."

**Pete Carroll:** "We scripted chunk plays and hit 'em—just gotta finish with the ball."

## 🎯 What It Means Going Forward

- **Raiders (5-10)** snap a four-game skid, keep faint playoff hopes alive in a muddled AFC (they need to win out + help).
- **Texans (11-4)** clinch AFC South with the win and move to No. 2 seed entering Week 17.

**Next up:**
- LV hosts Denver in Christmas Eve prime-time.
- HOU travels to Baltimore for a possible 1-seed dress rehearsal.

## 🏁 Bottom Line

Las Vegas finally looked like a professional offense again—188 scrimmage yards from a rookie star, zero sacks allowed, two 50-plus splash plays. But against Houston's clock-chewing attack, one pick-six plus two back-breaking 3rd-and-long flags were enough to tilt the razor-thin margin. Moral victories don't count in the standings, yet the Silver & Black fly home believing their season's pulse still flickers—if only for one more short week.
