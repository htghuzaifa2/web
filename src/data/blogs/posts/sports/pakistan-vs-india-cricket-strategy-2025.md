Pakistan’s game plan against India has shifted from “wait for mistakes” to “hit hard early”, but the scoreboard still flashes the same old story. Below is the short, student-friendly breakdown of what Pakistan says, what Pakistan does, and why India still wins.

## 1. Power-play pledge vs post-drink collapse
*   **Pakistan says:** “High risk, high strike-rate” – 91 runs in first 10 overs (highest ever vs India).
*   **Pakistan does:** 38 runs in next 7 + 39-ball boundary drought → comfort zone > courage.
*   **India does:** Bumrah & spin trio tighten screws; dot balls force big shots → cluster dismissals.
*   *Translation: We start like Fire, finish like Fizzle.*

## 2. Batting depth promise vs middle-order mediocrity
*   **Pakistan plan:** “Intent from ball 1” – Hesson drops Babar & Rizwan for Talat, Agha, Nawaz (strike-rates 111-117).
*   **India plan:** Gill + Abhishek strike at 140+ throughout; lower order (Dube, Varun) clears rope at will.
*   **Result:** Pak’s Nos. 4-6 combined 48 off 43; India’s same slots finish at 2-run-a-ball.

## 3. Bowling blueprint vs death-over reality
*   **Pakistan target:** Early swing (Shaheen 1-3) + spin middle (Nawaz).
*   **India exploit:** Pak leaks 115 runs in last 10 in 3 straight ODIs (110, 113, 123) – worst death-over economy in Asia Cup 2025.
*   **India death:** Bumrah yorker clinic + Shami historic strike-rate 25.4 – fastest to 200 ODI wickets.
*   *Moral: We plan yorkers, they land yorkers.*

## 4. Training tempo gap (visual proof)
*   **India** arrives 40 min early, side-arm throwers set, Tilak faces 45 min spin on knees (extra practice).
*   **Pakistan** arrives 10 min late, football warm-up, no side-arm throwers, nets = trial & error.
*   **Coaching insight:** “Hum abhi wahaan nahi pahunche hain” – veteran Pak journalist.

## 5. What still works for Pakistan
*   **Haris Rauf death overs** – 34 wickets since 2021, most by any bowler in last 4 overs.
*   **Saim Ayub power-play muscle** – six off Axar shows template can work if middle copies top.
*   **Fix:** Keep intent, but add rotation drill – dot-ball addiction is the real virus.

**Bottom line**
Pakistan talks “Baz-ball”, walks “Babar-ball”; India talks little, executes lot. Until Pak’s middle-order finishes what openers start, scoreline remains a broken record: India wins, Pakistan learns, fans meme.
