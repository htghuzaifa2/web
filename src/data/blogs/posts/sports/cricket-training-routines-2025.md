I once tried to copy Virat Kohli’s Instagram workout and couldn’t walk for three days. Below is the actual schedule the big boys follow – useful stuff first, my ego later.

## 1. Gym-day structure (copy-paste ready)
Frequency: 3-4 x week, ≤ 60 min/session to avoid “gym-killer” fatigue.

| Block | Exercise | Sets x Reps | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power** | Trap-bar jumps | 3 x 5 | Explosive hip drive = quick singles |
| **Power** | Med-ball rotational throws | 3 x 8/side | Bat speed & throwing power |
| **Strength** | Back squat | 4 x 6 | Leg strength for long innings |
| **Strength** | Bench press | 4 x 6 | Upper-body oomph for big hits |
| **Core** | Pallof press (anti-rotation) | 3 x 10 | Lower-back shield against twist injuries |
| **Conditioning** | Assault bike 0.5 mile x 3 | HR @ 120 bpm | Tank refuel without jogging till boredom |

*Rest: 2 min between power sets, 90 sec strength, 60 sec core.*

## 2. Warm-up that saves your hamstring (and pride)
*   **Foam roll** – 30 s each: quads, hams, adductors, low-back, T-spine → breaks morning-stiffness.
*   **Dynamic:** lizard lunge + T-spine rotation → copies batting rotation pattern.
*   **Activation:** band-resisted dead bugs → core switches ON before heavy lifts.
*   *Total warm-up: 8 min; skip it and you’ll skip matches too.*

## 3. Running combo – sprint first, jog later
**Pre-season weekly:**
*   10 m dash x 3 ( full recovery ) → acceleration off the crease.
*   5-10-5 shuttle x 4 → fielding burst left-right-left.
*   2 km easy jog once → aerobic base so you’re still smiling at 40th over.
*   *Secret: sprint on grass in spikes; treadmill is only for rainy days.*

## 4. Core & anti-rotation (lower-back insurance)
*   **Half-kneeling inline chop** – 8 reps/side, 3 sets → copies bowling follow-through.
*   **Side plank (top leg raised)** – 45 s/side → lateral stability when you land front-foot.
*   *Do it at end of gym session; core = tired = injury-proof.*

## 5. Cool-down = career longevity
*   Diaphragmatic breathing 2 min → heart-rate drops, parasympathetic kicks in.
*   Pigeon pose 2 min/side → opens hip so next net session doesn’t start with a pull.
*   *Skip cool-down and you’ll bat like a rusty gate next day.*

## 6. Weekly micro-cycle (student-friendly)

| Day | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | Gym power + core |
| **Tue** | Net skills + light jog |
| **Wed** | Gym strength + sprints |
| **Thu** | Rest / video analysis |
| **Fri** | Bowling/batting load + anti-rotation |
| **Sat** | Match simulation |
| **Sun** | Sleep + cheat biryani |

*Total gym time: ≈ 4 hrs/week; less than Netflix you binge.*

## 7. Nutrition side-kick (non-negotiables)
*   **Protein:** 1.6 g/kg body-weight → chicken + daal + milk works.
*   **Pre-gym fruit (banana)** → quick carbs so you don’t faint mid-squat.
*   **Post-session:** **whey in lassi** → desi + effective.
*   **Hydration:** 3 L water; add nimbu if you like taste with benefits.

**Bottom line:** train smart, not Instagram flashy. Stick to the basics, progress load slowly, and you’ll bat longer than your phone battery lasts.
